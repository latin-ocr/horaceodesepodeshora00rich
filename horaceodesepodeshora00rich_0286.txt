21. With this summons of the
music girl, cf. 2, 11, 21 ff.—dic

before his time3 so he describes
himself, Epist. 1, 20, 24 f. corporis
emguz', praecanam, solibus aptum,

essem. With the sentiment, cf.
E pist. 2, 2, 2 1 1 lenior et melior fis ac-
cedente senecta. —iuventa z abla-
tim—consule Planco: 42 Bc, the
year of Philippi. Eighteen years
had cooled his ardor for amours as
well as for political lost causes.
The reminiscences here and in vv.
18 and 19 are intentional, calling up
the contrast between those troubled
times and the present peace.
