17, 15] HORATI

Saetosa duris exuere pellibus

laboriosi remiges Ulixei

volente Circa membra; tunc mens et sonus
relapsus atque notus in voltus honor.
Dedi satis superque poenarum tibi,
amata nautis multum et institoribus.
Fugit iuventas et verecundus color,
reliquit ossa pelle amicta lurida,

tuis capillus albus est odoribus;

nullum a labore me reclinat otium,

urget diem nox et dies noctem, neque est

15 f. The example of Circe is
well chosen. The poet prays that

tas et . . . color: modest youth's
fresh color.

Canidia like the early sorceress
will reverse her spell.-—saetosa:
tle. with swinish bristles. —duris
pellibus : abl. with exuere. — labori-
osi: Homeric πολύτλας, πολυτλή-
μων; best taken with Ulixei. Stin,
cf. 16, 60.

17 f. mens: Horace supposes
that Circe's victims lost their minds
as well as shapes, but in the Ho-
meric account their fate is made
the more pathetic because their
wits remain. —- sonus z voice.—
honor: in contrast to the ugly
swinish faces they had just put off.

20. amata. etc.: in this ironi-
cal compliment Horace gives Cani-
dia the best thrust.—nautis . . .
et institoribus : the lowest classes 3
cf. n. to 3. 6, 30.

21—36. With mocking extrava-
gance Horace describes his suffer-
ings.—fugit‚ reliquit. eto: note
the animated asyndeton—iuven-

22. Horace is reduced to skin
and bones. He may have derived
his description from Theoc. 2,
88 ff. καί μευ Ι,χρὼς μὲν ὃμοῗος
ἐγίνετο πολλάκι θάψῳ, Ι ἔρρευν δ’
ἐκ κεφαλᾶς πᾶσαι τρίχες · αὐτὸ. δὲ
λοιπὰ Ι ὄστι’ἔτ’ἣς καὶδέρμα. ·And
oftentimes my skin waxed wan as
the color of boxwood, and all my
hair was falling from my head, and

what was left of me was but skin ·

and bones' Cf. also

(Lang).
Sil. Ital. 2, 466 ff. iam lurida sola
Ι tecta cute et venis male iuncta
trementibus ossa ἱ exta nt, consump-
tis visu deformia membris.

bus: sweet smellz'ng (magic) un-
guents. Cf. 5, 59.

24 f. labore: distress. —urgetz

ditur dies die. Note the effective
order of the following. — neque est
