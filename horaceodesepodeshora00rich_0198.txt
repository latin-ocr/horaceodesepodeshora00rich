HORATI

Saturni veteris; tuque pedestribus
10 dices historiis proelia CaesariS,
Maecenas, melius ductaque per vias
regum colla minacium.

Me dulcis dominae Musa Licymniae
cantUS, me voluit dicere lucidum
ις fulgentis ocuIOS‚ et bene mutuis
fidum pectus amoribus;

quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris
nec certare ioco nec dare bracchia

9f. tuque: emphatically intro-
ducing the specific reason why
Horace cannot celebrate Caesar³s
deeds, -⁴And then you will tell,'
etc.—pedestribus . . . historiis:
prose, in contrast to poetry. Hor-
ace was the first to adopt this term,
in imitation of the Greek πεζὸς
λόγος. There is no evidence that
Maecenas ever undertook such a
work as Horace here suggests.

11 f. ducta: z'.e. in the trium-
phal procession. — colla: ‘with
chains about their necks.' Cf.
Epod. 7, 7 f. intactus aut Britan-
nus nt descenderet 1 sacra catena-
tus via, and Prop. 2, Ι, 33 f. with
reference likewise to Augustus'
triumphs (canerem) regum auratis
circumdata colla catenis 1 Actiaque
in sacra currere rostra via. —mi-
nacium: butjnst now threatening.

13. me . . . me: ‘My task is
this.' intr. 3o.—dominae: this
became under the empire the
regular title of address to a mar-

ried woman, like our ‘Mrs.,'
‘Madamss the Italian ‘donna'
Translate, my lady. — Licymniae:
ancient critics agreed that under
this name Terentia, Maecenas7
wife, is meant. The fact that the
two names are metrically identical
makes this very probable. So
Catullus calls Clodia, Lesbia; Ti-
bullus employs Delia for Plania,
etc. That Licymnia in any case
was a free-born Roman lady is
proved by v. 19 f. See note.—
cantus: modified by dulcis.—
bene: connect with fidum. Cf. Cic,
T use. 2, 44 bene magnus, and the
F rench bien. The opposite is
male‚· so 1, 17, 25 male dispar5
Verg. Α. 2, 23 malefida.

17 f. ferre pedem: to move lter
feet in, etc. Cf. Verg. G. 1, 11
ferte simul Faunique pedem.
Dancing, except as part of a
religious ceremony, was thought
unbecorning a Roman woman;
although the severity of custom was
