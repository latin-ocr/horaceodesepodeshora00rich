CARMINA

[3, ὃς 22

Paene occupatam seditionibus
delevit urbem Dacus et Aethiops,
15 hic classe formidatus, ille
missilibus melior sagittis,

Fecunda culpae saecula nuptias
primurn inquinavere et genus et domos;
hoc fonte derivata clades
20 in patriam populumque fluxit.

Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos
matura virgo et fingitur artibus,

taken from the Romans. —renidet t
beams wz'tlz ιῐείζξῆίς hence used like
gaudet (v. 21) with an infinitive.
13 ff. paene: with delevit.—
seditionibus3 it is important to re-
member that there was a strong
party in Rome hostile to Octa-
vian, so that the reference is not
simply to the struggle between
him and Antony, carried on out-
side of Italy. The point which
Horace 1s emphasizing 1s that not
only had the Romans failed in
their attempts against foreign foes,
but in the passion of civil strife had
almost handed over the city to the
mercies of the barbarian Dacian
and Egyptian.—-Dacus et Aethiops:
Dacian bowmen served in Antony's
land forces, while the Egyptian na-
val contingent was two hundred
ships. That the Romans about
this time had a lively fear of an
invasion by the Dacians there can
be no doubt. Cf. n to 1, 26, 3 f.
17 ff. Horacehere turns to a new
cause for the state's degeneracy —

the decay of domestic virtue, the
growth of immorality. With the
following strophes‚ cf. 3, 24, 19-243
4, 5, 21-24. —fecunda: bag wz'tlz.
—inquinaverez cf. Epod. 16, 64.

21 ff. motus Ionicos: voluptu-
ous dances introduced from Ionia.
motus is the technical expression
for a mimetic dance. The old-
fashioned Romans did not look
with favor on dancing‚ save in
connection with worship3 custom
had, however, somewhat relaxed
even in the time of the Gracchi.
Macrobius 3, 14, 6 f. has preserved
the complaint of Scipio Africanus,
who bewailed the fact that boys
and girls had come to associate
with actors and learn songs and
dances which a former generation
would have considered disgrace-
ful for a freeborn person to know.

22 ff. matura: i.e. tempestiva
viro 1, 23. 12. ‘Even if these
dances and airs might be forgiven
in a child, they cannot be over-
