CARMINA

[42 152 32

²5 Nosque et profestis lucibus et sacris
inter iocosi munera Liberi,
curn prole matronisque nostris
rite deos prius adprecati,

virtute functos more patrum duces
30 Lydis remixto carmine tibiis
Troiamque et Anchisen et almae
progeniem Veneris canemus.

list of peoples should be compared
with that in 4, 14, 41—52. It will
be noted that none of the peoples
here named were actually subject
to Rome3 but as remote nations
which had more or less dealings
with Rome, they appealed to the
Roman imagination.

25 ff. nos: marking the shift to
the Romans' own happy lot. —et
profestis . . . et sacris: ἵζε. every
day alike. —lucibus: cf. 4, 6, 423
11, 19. — iocosi munera Liberi:
the Hesiodic δῶρα Διωνύσου πολυ-
γηθέος. Cf. Ι, 18, 7.—cum prole,
etc.: each in his own home.—
rite: in prescribed fashion.

29, virtute functos ε varying
the common vita functos ,· cf. 2,
18, 38 laboribus functos. Trans-
late, who have done their noble

work. — more patrum: modifying
canemus. The custom of extoll-
ing the virtues of their ancestors
in song at banquets was an an-
cient one among the Romans, ac—
cording to Cato. Cf. Cic. Tusc.
4, 3 in Originibus dixit Cato
morem apud maiores lzunc epu-
larum fuisse, ut deinceps qui
accubarent canerent ad tibiam
clarorum virorum laudes atque
virtutes.

30 ff, Lydis : apparently a purely

ornamental epithet. —remixtot an -

unusual word—tibiis: dative. —
Anchisen et . . . progeniem Ve-
neris: i.e. the long line descended
from Anchises and Venus; but
the special reference is obviously
to Augustus, as in C. S. 50 clarus
Anchisae Venerisque sanguis.
