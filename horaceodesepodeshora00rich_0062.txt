waves of the deep become dearer
to them than the firm mainland.'

13 f. vidimus: tle. with our
own eyes, in the period between
Caesar‘s murder and the date of
writing.—flavum: the fixed epi-
thet of the Tiber. Cf. 1, 8, 8
cm‘ limet flavum Tiberim langere,
and 2, 3, 18 villaque, flavus quam
Tiberis law& also Verg. A. 7, 31
multa flavas arena. It has been
adopted by the modern poets.—
retortis . . . undis: a glance at
the map of Rome will show that
the bend in the river above the
island would naturally throw the
Tiber's stream, in time of flood,
over the Velabrum between the
Capitol and Palatine‚ and thence
into the Forum proper.—litore:
abl. of separation. litus is fre-
quently equivalent to ripam eg.
Virg. A. 8, 83 viridique in litore
conspicitur sas. The popular be-
lief, however. seems to have been,
that such floods were caused by
waves or tides driving back the
waters of the river. Cf. Ovid
