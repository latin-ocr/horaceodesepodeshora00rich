HORAT1

5 quid Tiridaten terreat, unice

,securUS.

O quae fontibus integris

gaudeS, apricos necte flores,
necte meo Lamiae coronam,

Pimplea dulcis,
ιο prosunt honoreS.

Nil sine te mei
Hunc fidibus noviS,

, hunc Lesbio sacrare plectro
teque tuasque decet sorores,

formidatus, ille Ι missilibus melior
sagittis ; Verg. G. 2, 497 coniurato
descendens Dacus ab Histro. He
was finally crushed by P. Crassus
in the campaigns of 30-28 B.C.

5. Tiridaten: not long before
the battle ofActium‚ Tiridates suc-
cessfully revolted against Phraates,
king of the Parthians, and suc-
ceeded him on the throne. In 30
B.C. Phraates returned to the con-
test and forced his rival to flee for
safety to Augustus, who was at that
time in Egypt. Cf. Mon. Anc. 5, 54ff.
ad me supp[li]ces confitg [erunt]
reges Parthorum Tirida [tes et po-
stea] Plzrat [es] regis Phrati[s fi-
lius]. The accounts of Justin and
Dio Cassius, our chiefauthorities for
these points‚' are conflicting, but
apparently Tiridates was again
placed on the throne in 29 B.C. —-
cf. 3, 8, 19 f. Medus infestus sibi
luctuosis Ι dissidet armis—only to
be displaced again in 27 B.C. by
Phraates, who had collected a large
force of friendly Scythians to aid
him. Tiridates then fled to Au·
gustus, who was in Spain. -unice
securus. perfectly at ease.

6. fontibus integris: fresh,
pure fountains shall furnish the in-
spiration of his new song (fidibus
novis). The same figure Lucret.

fontis atque haurire.

7. necte floreS‚ etc.: zze. exalt
him in song. Cf. Pind. O. 6, 86 f.
ἀνδράσιν αἰχματαῖσι πλέκων Ι ποι-
κίλον ὕμνον.

9 f. Pimplea: Mose of Pim-
plea ,· named from a fountain of the
Muses in Pieria near Mt. Olympus.
Cf. Orph. 46 A. Πιμπληιάδες. —-
mei honores: τῖε. conferred by⁴
my verse. Cf. Verg. A. 9, 446
fortunati ambo! si quid mea car-
mina possiam—hunc . . . hunc:
Lamia.

11. Lesbio . . . plectro: marking
his new verse (fidibus nobis) as
modelled on that ofAlcaeus. Cf. 1,
1, 34 Lesboum ‘. . . barbiton. The
plectrum was a small ivory or
metal instrument with which the
strings of the lyre were struck.'
- sacrare : consecrate‚· ‘ canonize.'
Cf. Stat. Sz'lv. 4, 7, 7f. si tuas

cantu Latio sacravi, l Pindaro,
Thebas.
