CARMINA [3, 5, 20

oblitus aeternaeque Vestae,
incolumi Iove et urbe Roma?

Hoc caverat mens provida Reguli
dissentientis condicionibus
¹5 foedis et exemplo trahenti
perniciem veniens in aevum,

si non periret immiserabilis
captiva pubes, ‘ Signa ego Punicis
adfixa delubris et arma
ιο militibus sine caede ’ dixit

the bravest of the Italian peoples
(cf. 2, 20, 18); here joined with
the sturdy Apulians (cf. 1, 22, 14),
Horace's fellow countrymen. -an-
ciliorum: the ancilia were among

ἱ the sacred ngnora imperii, and

were in charge of the Salii. See
Cl. Dz‘ct. s.v. Salii. - nominis :
sc. Romani. —togae: the distinc-
tive dress of the Romans, the gens
togata.

11 f. aeternae Vestae: the ever·
burning fire on the hearth of Vesta
was symbolical of the permanency
of the state. ——incolurni Iove: z'.e.
‘while Jove's temple stands.'
With the three verses, cf. Florus
2, 21, 3 patriae, nominis, togae,
fascium oblitus (Antonius).

13 ff. hoc: emphatic, it was tlzz's
very thing—Reguli: M. Atilius
Regulus, consul 256 B.c., was cap-
tured by the Carthaginians in
Africa in 255 B.C. According to
the common tradition he was sent
to Rome in 250 B.c. to treat for

peace or to obtain at least an ex-
change of prisonerS, but persuaded
the Senate to decline to consider
either proposition. Polybius does
not refer to this mission, so that
the correctness of the tradition
has been called into question, but
in Cicero's time it had become a
favorite commonplace. Cf. Cic.
de Off 1, 393 3, 993 de Orat. 3,
1093 Livy per. 18. —condicionibus
foedis: 2'.e. those proposed by the
Carthaginians. — exemplo trahen-
ti: a precedent destined to bring.

17 f. si non periret: explain-⁷
ing exemplo trahenti. The subj.
represents peribit of Regulus'
speech. For the quantity periret
See Intr. 35.—signa: this would
recall to the Roman's mind Cras-
sus' standards, still in the hands
of the Parthians. —egoz ‘with my
own &esst—militibus sine caede,
etc.; note the ironical contrast,
‘soldiers who yielded up their
arms —— without a struggle.'
