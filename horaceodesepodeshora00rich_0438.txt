a slave. So the Greek παῖ.-- Horace is on the sea off Actium
Chia . . . Lesbia: sweet Greek and beginning to suffer from sea-

wines which used in excess might
well produce the ‘rising qualms'
mentioned in the next verse. The
frankness with which this result
of overdrinking is mentioned was
less offensive to the ancient than
to us. There is no reason for
saying as some have done that

sickness.

IO

A propempticon to the poet Mevius, hated by Horace and the circle
to which he belonged. Vergil has secured immortality for Mevius and
his associate Bavius by his verses E. 3, 90 f. qni Bavium non odit,
amet tua carmina. Asew} Ι atque idem z'mlgczl vulpes et mldgeat hircos.
The ill-nature of Horace's poem should be compared with the good
wishes in the propempticon addressed to Vergil C. Ι, 3.

That this epode also is modeled on a poem by Archilochus is shown
by a fragment recovered from a papyrus sheet in 1899.¹ The begin-
ning, which probably contained the name of the poet's false friend, is
lost3 the fragment, as restored, is as follows:

κύμ<ατι> πλα<ζόμ>ενος.

κάν Σαλμυδ<ησσ>ᾥ γυμνὸν εὐφρονέσ<τατα>
Θρήϊκες ἀκρό<κο>μοι

λάβοιεν (ἔνθι πολλ’ ἀναπλήσει κακὰ
δούλιον ἄρτον ἔδων)

ῥίγει πεπηγότ’ αὐτόν· ἐκ δὲ τοῦ <ῥό>θου
φυκία πόλλ’ ἐπ<έ>χοι,

κροτέοι δ’ ὀδόντας, ὡς <κύ>ων ἐπὶ στόμα
κείμενος ἇκρασίῃ
