natural instrument for arousing
and directing his subjects. Cf.
2, 10, 18 quondam cithara tacentem
suscitat musam . . . Apollo. Also
Ovid. A. A. 2, 493 f. llaec ego cum
canerem subito manifestus Apollo Ι
movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae.

3 f. The metaphor is common
for bold undertakings3 cf. eg.
Prop. 4, 9, 3 f. quid me scribendi
tam vastum mittis in aequor Β Ι
non sunt apta meae grandia vela
rati. —parvaz as befitting his
lyric verse. Cf. 1, 6, 9 tenues
grandia, etc. —tua aetas: the
abruptness of the transition brings

9 f. Ianum Quirini: avariation
of the common lanum Quirinum,
the name given the temple as well
as the god. The shrine stood
near the north end of the Forum.
— clausit: in 29 and 25 13.c. The
gates had then not been closed
since the end of the First Punic
War. They were shut a third
time during Augustus' rule, but
the exact year is not known.
When Horace wrote the gates
were open. —evagantiz transitive.
Intr. 86.—frena‚ etc.: Horace's
hope expressed 3, 24, 28 f. is ful-
filled. With the expression, cf.
Val. Max. 2, 9, 5 freni sunt iniecti
vobis, Quirites: lex enim lata est,
quae vos esse frugi iubet.
