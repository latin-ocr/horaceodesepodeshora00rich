ι, 28, ι] HORATI
shore addresses Archytas (1-6)‚ who in spite of all his wisdom, which
enabled him to measure heaven and number the very sands‚ now lies
under a little earth3 this leads the shade to moralize on the universality
of death, which comes to all without distinction (7—22). The last two
verses of this part close the illustrations with the speaker's persona] ex-
perience in the true Horatian manner. In the second part (23-36) the
spirit appeals to a passing sailor to throw a little vdust on its unburied
body, that it may find rest in Hades.

Archytas was a statesman. general, and philosopher of Tarentum3
according to tradition a friend of Plato. As a member of the Pythago-
rean school he tried to explain the physical universe by mathematics.
Metre, 77. ·

Te maris et terrae numeroque carentis harenae
mensorem cohibent, Archyta,

pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum
munera, nec quicquam tibi prodest
5 aerias temptasse domos animoque rotundum
percurrisse polum morituro.

1 ff. The opening verses are simi-
lar to Simias' epigram on Sopho-
cles Anth. Pal. 7, 21 σὲ . . . τὸν τρα-
γικῆς Μούσης ἀστέρα . . . τύμβος
ἔχει καὶ γῆς ὀλίγον μέρος. - numero
carentis arenae mensorem ε note the
slight oxymoron. Possibly there
is a reminiscence of Archimedes'
treatise ψαμμίτης, in which he main-
tained against his opponents that
the sands could be counted ς or this
subject may have been treated in
a philosophica] work by Archytas
himself. In any case there is a
certain irony in this reference to
the vanity of human effort, which
the contrast in the succeeding
cohibent (hold fast) emphasizes.

3. pulveris...munera: tlze small
gift qf a little dust,· tle. his nar-

row tomb. Cf. Verg. G. 4, 86 f. lzz'
motus animorum atque llaec cer-
tamina tanta Ι pulveris exlgui
iactu compressa quiescunt. -Μειἢ
tinum: explained by Porphyrio as
a mountain or promontory of Apu-
lia3 it is uncertain which.

5. aerias temptasse domos, etc.:
ἵζε. to have explored in his astro-
nomical studies. The verb tempe
tasse itself implies boldness on Ar-
chytas' part in venturing to extend
his researches to the heavens.—
animo: in spirim to be taken with
both infinitives.—morituro z agree-
ing with tibi. Its position at the end
throws emphasis on the vanity of
Archytas' wisdom,— ‘ What availed
it thee to practice all thy science?
Thou wert destined to die none
