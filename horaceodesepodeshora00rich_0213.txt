CARM IN A

[2‚ 16, 32

Scandit aeratas vitiosa navis
Cura nec turmas equiturn relinquit,
ocior cervis et agente nimbos

ocior Euro,

25 Laetus in praesens animus quod ultra est
oderit curare, et amara lento
temperet risu: nihil est ab omni

parte beatum.

Abstulit clarum cita mors Achillem,
30 longa Tithonum minuit senectus,
et mihi forsan tibi quod negarit

porriget hora.

Sen. Epist. 28, 2 quaeris, quare
te fuga ista non adiuvet .? tecum
fugas,- and Emerson Self-Reli-
ance, 6Ι pack my trunk . . . and
at last wake up in Naples, and
there beside me is the stern fact,
the sad self, unrelenfing, identi-
cal‚ that Ι fied from.'

21—24. An amplification of the
preceding two verses—‘neither
ship nor horse is swift enough to
escape pursuing care.' The same
idea is better expressed 3, 1, 37 ff.
—— aeratas : bronze-beaked. -— viti-
osa: carking, morbid—ocior . . .

ocior: emphasizing the swiftness'

with which care moves. Intr. 28c.

25. ‘Take with J'oy the present
hour, do not be “careful’' of to-
morrow.' Cf. with the injunction
contained in the subject laetus

. animm, 3, 8, 27 f. dona prae-
sentis cape laetus horae ac Ι lin-

que severa. —oderitz subjunctive,
shrink from. —lentoz quiet, as
befits a man who knows how to
meet life's changes.

29 ff. Concrete illustration of
the general statement in v. 27 s.
-clarumt glorians. Notice its
position next to cita mors, ‘for
all his glory death carne quickly.'

30. The opposite fate of Titho-
nus. Cf. n. to 1, 28, 8.—longa:
τί. aeterna, as 2, 14, 19.

31 f. et mihi: Horace here, as
frequently, drives horne his state-
ments by persona] illustrations at
the close. The following two
strophes give the details of the
bold comparison between himself
and Grosphus. The contrast is
modestly put. but the poet's pride
rings in the last words, malignum
spernere volgus. — tibi : with nega-
rit—hora: tlte chance haur.
