38 ff. laborem decipitur: are
beguiled to for-get their toz'l. In
sense the phrase is like laborem
fallere S. 2, 2, 12. Probably de-
cipitur is to be regarded as a
middle. For the meaning of
labor, cf. n. to Epod. 17, 64. —-

A lament on thefleeting character of life. ‘Alas‚ good friend,
do what we will, old age and death corne on apace. No sacrifice ean
stay the hand of the pitiless lord of death 3 rich and poor alike must corne
unto his malm, and all thy efforts to avoid war, the sea, or fell disease
are vain. Thou must leave all behind that thou holdest now most dear.
Then thy stored wine, thy heir, worthier than thou, will waste.' In the
last strophe Horace in negative fashion returns to his philosophy of life,
⁴ Seize the pleasure of the passing bour, and do not waste your time in
gathering wealth you do not use yourself. To-morrow we alldie and
another wastes our savings.'

The Postumus to whom the ode is addressed was an imaginary
personage3 at least the name was so used by Martial 2, 23, 1 f. non
dicam, licet usque me rogetis, Ι quis sit Postumus in meo libello, and
5, 58, 7 f. cras vives 59 hodie iam vivere, Postume, serum est: 1 ille
sapit, quisquis, Postume, vixit heri. Horace’s thoughts frequently
turned to death3 but this and 4, 7 are his finest treatments of the
theme. There is no indication of the date of composition. Metre‚ 68.

Eheu fugaces, Postume, Postume,
labuntur anni, nec pietas moram

1-4, eheu: the opening word fleeting character of life3 and the
is a sigh, which indicates the repetition of the proper name
gloomy nature of the entire ode. shows the poet's earnestness.—
The second word emphasizes the labuntur: slz'p by, before we notice
