9. iam bis, eto: the Romans
had actually suffered three defeats
in the east: that of Crassus at
Carrhae 53 ss.C.; that of Decidius
Saxa by Pacorus in Syria 40 B.c. ς

and that of Antony in Media 36
B.C. As the defeat of Saxa was
avenged in 38 B.C. by Ventidius,
Horace may refer to the first and
third disasters only, but it is need-
less to demand historical accuracy
of a poet in every case. The only
Monaeses known to us was a Par-
thian noble who sought refuge
from Phraates IV with Antonius
in 37 B.C. 3 he afterwards became
reconciled to Phraates and de-
serted Antony.
