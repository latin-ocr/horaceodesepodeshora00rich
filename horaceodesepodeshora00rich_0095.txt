‘What hero, demigod, or god, dost thou prepare to sing, O Muse?
‚Whose name shall echo on Helicon, on Pindus, or on Haemus' height,
where Orpheus charmed all nature with his strains? (1—12). Of gods
first surely father Jove ; then his daughter Pallas, then Liber, Diana, and
Phoebus ( 13—24). The demigod, Alceus’ grandson. will Ι celebrate, and
the twin brothers, who guard sailors from the angry sea (25—32). Then
the great Romans, Romulus, Tarquin, Cato, and the long line of heroes
after them (33-44). Marcellus' fame is growing: the Julian star out-
shines the rest (45—48). Father and guardian of men, in thy care is
mighty Caesar, greatest of all the Roman line. May his rule be second to
thine only; may he conquer the Parthians and the remotest Eastern peo-
ples, and rule the wide wide world ; still shall he he thy subject, for thou,
thou only shalt ever be Lord of Olympus, the Punisher of crime (49—60) .‘
