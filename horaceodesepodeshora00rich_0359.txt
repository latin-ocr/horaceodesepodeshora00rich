’ CARMINA

6

A prelude to the Carmen Saeculare.

⁶ Apollo, thou who didst punish Niobe and Tityos, and didst lay low
Achilles for all his prowess3 he who but for thee and Venus would have
slain ruthlessly every Trojan child, so that none would have remained
to found another state with better auspices (1-24). Thou divine min-
strel, guard, I pray, the glory of the Daunian Muse (25—28). Phoebus
it is who gives me my power and name. Ye noble maids and boys,
mark well the measure. Sing Apollo and Diana. Proud shall be thy
boast when matron that at the great festival thou didst render the song
of the poet Horace (29-44).'

The poem thus falls into two divisions— the prayer to Apollo (1—28)‚
and the address to the chorus of boys and girls that is to sing the Secu-
lar Hyrnn (31-44). The two parts are connected by vv. 29-30, in
which Horace acknowledges that he owes his inspiration, skill, and even
name of poet to the god. The date of composition is evidently not far
from that of the Carmen Saeculare, 17 ss.c. Metre, 69.

ι’. dive: Apollo, as the follow-
ing verses clearly show. The in-
vocation is resumedvv. 2 5 and the
verb, defende, is not found until
v. 27.—pr01es Niobea: the seven
sons and seven daughters whom
Apollo and Diana shot down to
punish Niobe for her boast that,
while Leto bore but two children,
she had many. In Horace's day
a group representing the slaying
was to be seen in the portico of
Apollo's temple, built by C. Sosius.
The group was thought to be the
work of Praxiteles or Scopas.
Fragments of a similar group are
now in the Uffizi in Florence.

Certain figures are reproduced in
Baumeister 3, pp. 1673 ff.
