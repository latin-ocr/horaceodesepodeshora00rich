3, 19, 1] HORATI

19

‘ You prate of ancient genealogies and wars, but never a word do you
say on the real questions of the moment—how much we shall pay for a
jar of wine, how, where, and when we shall drink. Come, a toast to
the Moon, to the Night, to our· friend Murena, the augur. The wine
shall be mixed as your tastes demand3 give music, scatter flowers, and
let old Lycus hear our din and envy our light loves.'

Horace thus dramatically portrays a company which has fallen into
serious conversation on mythological subjects‚ and forgotten the pur-
pose of the gathering. In the first two strophes he recalls his compan-
ions from their soberer talk3 then suddenly assuming the character of
magister bibendi, he names the toasts, the strength of the wine that
shall be used, and calls for flowers and music. The occasion for the
ode may have been a symposium in Murena's honor (v. 10 f.)‚ but it is
more likely that the poet's imagination gave the impulse for the lines.
They should be compared with C. 1, 27. The date of composition

cannot be determined. Metre, 71.

questions were no doubt frequently
discussed by litterateurs in Hor-
