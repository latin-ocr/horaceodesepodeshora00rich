praeeeps Anio). For Horace's af-
fection for Tivoli, see Sellar p. 179 f.
— domus Albuneae: a grotto in
which *here was an ancient Italian
oracle3 hence the name of the last
of the Sibyls. Cf. Verg. A. 7, 82 ff.
lucosque sub alta Ι consulit Albu-
nea, nemorum quae maxuma sacro
f fonte sonat.

13 f. Tiburni: Tiburnus, grand-
son ofAmphiaraus‚ the Argive seer:
according to tradition he was ban-
ished with his brothers Coras and
Catillus, and became with them
'the founder of Tibur. Cf. 2, 6, 5
T ibnr Alget) positum colom). Ca-
tillusgave his name to the moun-
tain behind the town 3 but was also
associated with the town itself. Cf.
1, 18, 2 circa mile solum Tiburis
et moenia Catili. -lucusz a sacred
grove, distinguished from nemus,
the more general word. — uda
mobilibus, etc.: the Anio with its
restless streams (mobilibus rivis)

(pomaria). Cf. Prop. 5, 7, 81 po-
ηθεῖς Anio qua spumifer incubat

15 f. The only connection be-

tween the preceding and that which ’

follows is Tiburis umbra tui, v. 21.
‘You and Ι love Tibur beyond all
other places3 the thought of that
spot reminds me of thee ς learn tbe
lesson osan easy life wherever thou
mayest be.' It must be acknowl-
edged that the connection is very
slight. We may have here in reality
a combination of two ‘fragments'
which Horace never completed. Cf.
introductory n. to Ι, 28. - albus
Notus: the south wind usually
brought rain (nubilus Azcster); but
sometimes clearing weather (albus,
λευκόνοτος), and wiped (deterget)
the clouds from the sky. —parturit τ
breeds. Cf. 4, 5, 26 f. quis (paveat)
Germania quos horrida parturit 1
setus.

17. perpetuos: cf. v. 6 above. -
sapiens, etc. : be wisc and remember.

19. molli: mellow.

20. tenent . . . tenebit:
change in tense.

21 ff. Again the connection with
the preceding is slight, but the
pointing of a general statement
