9-16. The contrast between
the luxury of the rich and Horace's
simplicity is emphasized. 4 pre-
mant: check, prune‚· used by poets
for the prose putant5 eg. Verg.
G. 1, 157 ruris'opacz' falce premes

* umbras.——Calena falce: cf. 1, 20,

9. —- quibus dedit: sc. premere.

11. culullis: according to Por-
phyrio, these were properly earth-

rich with trade uses cups of solid
gold.

guents‚ and costly persumes im-
ported from the Orient.

ticiple with quippe is equivalent to

tory clause—aequor Atlanticum:
Gades (Cadiz)‚ buta short distance

outside the straits of Gibraltar, was
practically the limit of navigation
for the Romans ς the Atlantic was an
unknown and fearful ocean. With
the thought, cf. Aristot. apud lamb.
Protrep. 6 οὐ δὲ δεῖ χρημάτων μὲν
ἕνεκα πλεῖν ἐφ’ ιΗρακλέους στήλας
καὶ πολλάκις κινδυνεύειν, διὰ δὲ
φρόνησιν μηδὲν πονεῖν μηδὲ δαπα-
νᾶν. ‘Nor for wealth need one
sail to the pillars of Heracles and
risk his life many times, but for
prudence' sake he should not toil
or spend (overmuch).'

15f. mez the position of the
persona] pronoun emphasizes the
contrast. Cf. n. to 1,1‚ 29. Intr.

2, 57 f. gravi Ι malvae salubres
corpori.

17 f. paratis: equivalent to par-
tis, my possession& —valido . . .
integra cum mente : cf. the familiar
words of Juvenal (10, 3 56) orandum
est ut sit mens sana in corpore
sano.
