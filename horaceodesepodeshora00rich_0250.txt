HORATI

visam Britannos hospitibus feros
et laetum equino sanguine Concanum,
35 visam pharetratos Gelonos
et Scythicum inviolatus amnem.

Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
fessas cohortis abdidit oppidis,
finire quaerentem labores
40 Pierio recreatis antro.

Vos lene consilium et datis et dato

gaudetiS, almae.

33ff. Britannos: Augustus’ pro-
jected expedition against the Brit-
ons may have occasioned their
mention here (cf. introductory n.
to 1, 35) ; or they may have been
chosen as a type of the peoples
living on the borders of the world.
Cf. 1, 3 5, 30 ultimos orbis Britan-
nos.—hospitibus feros: TacitUS,
A nn. 14, 30, pictures them as sav-
ages.—-Concanum: a Cantabrian
tribe3 cf. 2, 6, 2. Verg. G. 3, 463,
says that the Geloni drink horses'
blood mixed with milk. Statius,
Achil. 1, 307, attributes a similar
custom to the Massagetae—Gelo-
nos: cf. 2, 9, 23; 20. 19.—-Scythi-
cum amnem: the Tanais, Don. Cf.
3, 10, 1.—inviolatus: predicate,—
and still remain unharmed.

37 ff. vos: connecting this stro-
phe with the preceding, and bring-
ing us back to the main theme of
this part of the ode‚—the Muses
and their influence.——altum: ex-
alted.—militia simul, etc.: after

Scimus ut impios

the battle of Actium Augustus
settled 120,000 veterans on lands,
spending enormous sums for -this
purpose. In spite of the vexa-
tion that the confiscations of land
caused, this disposition of the
troops was doubtless a great relief
to many who feared that the victor
might use his forces to secure ty-
rannical power. — abdidit: aptly
expressing the disappearance of
the troops. —finire, etc. : Augustus'
great desire seems to have been
for peace ς the Roman world saw a
warrant of this in the disbanding
of his veterans just referred to.—
Pierio recreatis antro: z'.e. by liter-
ary pursuits in some quiet spot, as
in a cave sacred to the Muses. Cf.
1, 12, 6. When Octavian was re-
turning from the East in 29 13.c.,
he rested some time at Atella in
Campania, where on four succes-
sive days the Georgz'cs, which Ver-
gil had just finished‚ were read to
him by Vergil and Maecenas.
