CARMINA [3, 24, 5
of sin is death (1—24). He who will be known as father of the state.
must check the current license‚ trusting to posterity for his reward
(25-32). Our sin must be cut out, laws without the support of charac-
ter are vain. The source of our sin is greed for gain, so that neither
torrid heat nor northern cold check the eager trader3 for gold men do
and suffer all. Poverty alone is great disgrace. Then let us dedicate
to Jove or cast into the sea our gems and gold if we are really penitent
(33—50). Present luxury is too great. Our boys must be trained in a
sterner school. To-day no freeborn youth can ride his horse: yet he
is well skilled in weaker sports and dice. Honor and fidelity are gone.
Riches will still grow to barm, but never satisfy (51—64).'

This moralizing on riches as the source of evil is similar to much in
the opening odes of this book, especially to 3, 1, 14—44. Cf. also 2, 15 :
163 183 Epoa'. 16. The savior invoked in vv. 25 ff. is clearly Augustus,
who endeavored by legislation and example to check the growing
license of his time. His success was only slight and temporary in
spite of his words illan. Anc. 2, 12—14leg2'blts novis latis complura ex-
empla maiorum &volentia iam ex nostro usu reduxi et lpse multarum
rerum exempla haitanda posteris tradidi. The date of composition
cannot be determined, but probably the ode was written at about the
same time as 3, 1-6. Mene, 71.

the Romans had looted Asia
Minor and might be thought to be

East‚ Cf. Prop. 2, 10, 16 et domus
