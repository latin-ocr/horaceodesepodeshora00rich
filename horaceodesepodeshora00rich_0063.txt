Vestae: at the'foot of the Pala-
tine. For an account of the tem-
ple and of the house of the Vestal
Virgins, the atrium Vestae, see
Lanciani, ‘Ancient Rome in the
Light of Recent Discoveries,' p.
134 ff. The foundations of this
temple are only twenty-six feet
above the mean level of the Tiber.
That the ancient accounts of the
flooding of the Forum are not ex-
aggerated was shown by the flood
of December, 1900, which rose
quite as high as the one Horace
describes. There is an especial
significance in the mention of the
Regia and the temple of Vesta, for

of the Romans. Within the temple
of Vesta were the nguora imperii
on whose preservation, it was be-
lieved, the Roman empire's exist-
ence depended. With the plurals
monumenta and templa, cf. 3, 27,
75 lna nomina for nomen.

17. Iliae: the mother of the
twins Romulus and Remus. Hor-
ace here, as in 3, 3, 32, according
to Porphyrio, follows the older
tradition represented by Ennius.
This made Ilia the daughter of
Aeneas and sister of Iulus, from
whom the Julii derived their line.
After the birth of the twins she
was thrown into the Tiber in pun-
ishment for her infidelity to her
Vestal vows, but was saved by the
river god and became his wife. -—
nimium: with ultorem3 the river
is over eager to avenge lzis bride's
complaints. Cf. uxorius, below.

19 f. ripa: ablative denoting
the route taken, over llze bank.
But cf. Epod. 2, 25 νῑρἱ, between
tlze banks.—u11xorius: Intr. 69.
Horace here follows the example
of Sappho, who frequently treated
the third and fourth verses of this
strophe as one, eg. Frg. 2, 3f.
