CARMINA

[1. 5⁹4

et domus exilis Plutonia3 quo simul mearis,
nec regna vini sortiere talis
nec tenerum Lycidan mirabere, quo calet iuventus
20 nunc omnis et mox virgines tepebunt.

‘Charidas, what is below?
Deep darkness.. But what of the
passages upward? All a lie. But
Pluto? Onlytalk. Thenwe'relost.’

wine and love, and reminds his
friend that he must enjoy these
delights while he may. Death

will soon deprive him of them. —

hones ' which would ordinarily fall
on the longer sides3 the highest
throw (iactus Veneris) was when
each rested on a different side. —
Lycidan: a name invented for
the occasion.

To a coquette: ‘What slender innocent enjoys thy smiles to—day‚
Pyrrha? Alas, he does not yet suspect that thou art fickle as the sea;

thy smile lures on his love to shipwreck.
