CARMINA

Quid latet, ut marinae

filium dicunt Thetidis sub lacrimosa Troiae

¹5 funera, ne virilis

cultus in caedem et Lycias prOriperet catervas?

13 ffa‘ Ᾰ post-Homeric legend
told how Thetis, at the outbreak
of the Trojan war, knowing the
fate that awaited her son, Achilles,
if he went to Troy, hid him in
maiden‘s dress among the daugh-
ters of Lycomedes, king of Scyros.
(Cf. Bion 2, 15 ff. λάνθανε δ’ ἐν
κώραις Λυκομηδίσι μοῦνος Ἀχιλ-
λεύς, Ι εἴρια δ’ ἀνθ’ ὅπλων ἐδιδά-
σκετο, καὶ χερὶ λευκᾷ Ι παρθενικὸν
κόρον εἶχεν, ἐφαίνετο δ’ ἠύτε κώρα.
⁶ But Achilles alone lay hid among
the daughters of Lycomedes, and
was trained to work in wools, in
place ofarms, and in his white hand
held the bough of maidenhood, in

Here he was discovered by Ulys-
ses, who came in disguise as a
peddler bringing wares intended
to attract the attention of girls;
there were also in his pack some
weapons, by handling which Achil-
les betrayed himself. The story
is told by Ovid Met. 13, 162 ff.;
cf. Statius Achilleis 2, 44 f. The
discovery is shown in two Pom-
peian wall paintings‚ one of which=
is reproduced in Baumeister, no.

‘The world is bound in the fetters of snow and ice. Heap high the
fire to break the cold; bring out the wine. Leave all else to the gods;
whate'er to-morrow's fate may give, count as pure gain. To-day is
thine for love and dance, while thou art young'

The first two strophes at least are based on an ode of Alcaeus
of which we still have six verses3 the setting only is Italian. Alc.
Frg. 34 ὕει μὲν ὀ Ζεύς, ἐκ δ’ ὀράνω μέγας Ι χείμων, πεπάγασιν δ’
ὐδάτων ῥόαι. 1 . . . κάββαλλε τὸν χείμων’, ἐπὶ μὲν riom- Ι πῦρ. ἐν δὲ
κζρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως 1 μέλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ Ι μαλθακὸν
ἀμφκβαλὼν> γνόφαλλον. ‘Zeus sends down rain. and from the sky
there falls a mighty winter storin: frozen are the streams. Break down
the storm by heaping up the fire: mix sweet wine ungrudgingly. and
throw round thy head sweet lavendeff The last four strophes are
apparently Horace's own. The theme is the same as that of Epod. 13.
