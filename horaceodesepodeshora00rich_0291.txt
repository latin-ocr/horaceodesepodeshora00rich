CARMINA

[3‚ 16» 34

²5 contemptae dominus splendidior rei,
quam si quicquid arat impiger Apulus
occultare meis dicerer horreis,
magnas inter opes inops.

Purae rivus aquae silvaque iugerum
30 paucorum et segetis certa fides meae
fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae

fallit sorte beatior.

Quamquam nec Calabrae mella ferunt apeS‚
nec Laestrygonia Bacchus in amphora

25 f. contemptae: tle. by those
who-do not know the source of
true happiness—splendidior: in
the sight of the wise. -aratz put
for the product of the field. Cf.
t'ne use trallunt, 2, 18, 8. For
the quantity, see Intr. 35. —
impiger Apulus: cf. Epod. 2, 42.
Apulia was very productive accord-
ing to Strabo 6, 284.

27 f. occultare: apoetic variant
for condere 1, 1, 9.—magnas:
used like saevo3‚ v. 16 above. —inter
opes inops: an oxymoron express-
ing the difference between the
common view and the correct one.
Cf. Epist. 1, 2, 56 semper avarus
eget. Horace's phrase clung in
rnen's minds: Paulinus of Nola
at the end of the fourth century
reproduced it exactly, 28, 292 inter
opes inopem Seneca with a slight
variation, Epist. 74, 4 in divz‘itis
inopes, a phrase St. Ambrose re-
peated three centuries later.

29 f. Horace describes his farm

Epist. 1, 16. —rivusz cf. Epiust
Ι, 16, 12, quoted in introductory n.
to 3, 13. ——segetisz possessive gen.
-certa fides: cf. 3, 1, 30 fundus
mendax and n.

31 f. fulgentem imperio, etc..-
the proconsul of Africa is probably
meant, although it is possible that
we should think rather of a great
landed proprietor. The provinces
of Asia and Africa were assigned
each year to the two oldest men
of consular rank eligible.—fa111t
sorte beatior: happz'er in lot es-
capes the notice of, i.e. is a happl'er
lot, although he does not know it,
tlzan that os, etc. The Latin lan-
guage having no present participle
of esse, is unequal to the task of
imitating the Greek idiom λαν-
θάνει ὀλβιώτερον ὅν.

33 ff. Examples of the luxuries
possessed by the rich. Cf. 1, 31,
5 ff: 2, 16, 33 ff.—Calabrae. . .
apes: cf. 2. 6, 14 f.—Laestrygo-
nia: F ormian. See introductory
