Care (17—40).

HORATI

If then all that wealth can buy fails to ease the anxious

spirit, why should Ι exchange my humble happy lot for one that brings

only burdens with it (41-48).'

Metre, 68.

Odi profanum volgus et arceo.

Favete linguis !

Carmina non prius

audita Musarum sacerdos
virginibus puerisque canto,

5 Regum timendorum in proprios gregeS,
reges in ipsos imperium est IoviS,

1 f. Like a priest about to begin
sacrifice, Horace bids the uniniti-
ate, profanum volgus, withdraw.
Cf. Callim. Hymn. in Apoll. 2 ἑκάς,
ἑκάς, ὅστις ἀλιτρός (profanus);
Verg. A. 6, 258 procul θ, procul
este. profani. By profanum volgus
Horace means those who have not
heard, and will not listen to, the
teachings of the Muses. whose sa-
cred priest he is.—favete linguis:
the solemn call for holy silence,the
Greek εὐφημεῖτε. Cf. Ovid. Fasti
1, 71 linguis animisque favete. ——
carmina, etc.: hymns of new and
deeper meaning than have been
sung before. Many commenta-
tors wish to see here a reference
primarily to the new form, the
Alcaic measure in didactic verse
(cf. 2, 20, 13 3, 30, 13 and nn.);
but Horace has a more serious
intention.

3 f. Musarum sacerd'os: poets are
the inspired interpreters of the
Muses' will. Cf. Theoc. 16, 29
Μουσάων δὲ μάλιστα τίειν ἱεροὺς
ὑποφήτας. ‘To honor most of all

the sacred interpreters of the Mu-
ses'3 likewise Ovid. Am. 3, 8, 23
ille ego [Musarum purus Phoebique
sacerdos. Horace claims that his
sacred office gives him a right to
speak with authority.—virginibus
puerisque: i.e. the rising genera-
tion‚ on whom the state's whole
hope depends.

51². regum timendorum: modi-
fying imperium of the next verse —-
‘Kings rule their peoples, but are
themselves the subjects of Jove.'
The expression seems almost pro-
verbial. Cf. Philemon Frg. 31, 4.
δοῦλοι βασιλέων εἰσίν, ὃ βασιλεὺς
&ihm—in: over, showing the di-
rection in which their rule is exer-
cised. Cf. 4, 4. 2f. cui rex deorum
regnum in avis vagas Ι permisit.
—greges: lzerds, a contemptuous
word, fitting regum timendorum,
which would call up to the Roman
mind the thought of absolute ty-
rants, whose subjects were mere
cattle. Notice the chiastic order in
these and the two following verses.
