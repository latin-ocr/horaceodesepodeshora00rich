EPODON

LIBER [4‚ 11

Hibericis peruste funibus latus
et crura dura compede.
ς Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
fortuna non mutat genus.
Videsne, Sacram metiente te viam
cum bis trium ulnarum toga,
ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium
ιο liberrima indignatio ?
‘ Sectus flagellis hic-triumviralibus

3. Hibericis . . . funibus: made
of spartum, the tough Spanish
broom, used in antiquity for the
best ropes and cables (Plin. Ν. H.
19, 26).—peruste: scarrea'3 with
latus, body, and crura. For the
use of the word, cf. Epist. 1, 16, 47
loris non ureris.

4 ff. compede: fetters were used
only on the lowest slaves—am-
bules: strut abroad. Cf. 8, 143
Claudiam, in Eutrop. 1, 306 f.
erecto pectore dives Ι ambulat. —
fortuna: in the restricted sense of
our ‘fortune‚' as the previous line
shows.

7 f. sacram viam: the fashion-
able promenade at Rome, running
down from the Velia along the foot
of the Palatine through the Forum.
—metientez pacing‚ as if he pom-
pously would measure the street's
length—bis trium ulnarum: the
ulna was about half a yard3 this
rich man's toga was then three
yards wide, which made it pos-
sible for him to arrange it in elab-
orate folds. Such a toga was in
marked contrast to the engucz toga

such as simple Cato would wear³
which Horace mentions, Epist. ι,
19, 13.

9 f. vertat: ‘causes their color
to change with indignation! Cf.
S. 2, 8, 35 f. vertere pallor lum
parochi faciem. —huc et huc: up
and down, with euntium—liber-
rima: free spokem· cf. 11, 16.
The following lines give the words
of the indignant passers-by.

11. sectus: stronger than the
ordinary caesus. — triumviralibus ε
the tresviri capitales were police
commissioners whose chief duty
was the safe custody of condemned
persons and the execution of the
punishment inflicted by the court.
And under the Republic they were
responsible for good order in the
city. They had the power of
executing summary punishment on
disorderly persons and slaves.
Cf. Schol. Cic. Div. in Caecil.
16, 50 fares et servos nequam
qni apud lllw'ros capitales apud
[olmmmm risaem'am (where the
lllw'rz' capitales had their head-
quarters) puniri solent.
