Et ture et fidibus iuvat
placare et vituli sanguine debito
custodes Numidae deOS,

qui nunc Hesperia sospes ab ultima

caris multa sodalibus,

nulli plura tamen dividit oscula

quam dulci Lamiae, memor

actae non alio rege puertiae

mutataeque simul togae.
10 Cressa ne careat pulchra dies nota,
neu promptae modus amphorae

1 f. ture et fidibus: the regular
accompaniments of sacrifice. Cf.
4. ῐ, 21—24 illie plurima naribus Ι
duces tura, lyraeque et Berecyn-
thiae Ι delectabere tibiae Ι mixte&
carminibus non sine fistula. —de-
bito: i.e. vowed to the gods if Nu-
mida should have a safe return. Cf.
2, 7, 17 obligatam redde lovz‘dapem.

our ⁶ red-letter day.' We are told
that another way of marking the
course of one's life was to drop
each day a pebble ln an urn—
white for the happy, black for the
sad. References in literature are
not infrequent: eg. Catull. 68, 148
quem lapide illa diem candidiore
notet3 Plin. Epist. 6, 11 o diem
laetum notandumque milti candi·
