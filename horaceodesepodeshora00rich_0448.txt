HORATI

deUS, deus narn me vetat

inceptOS, olim promissum carmen, iambos
ad umbilicum adducere.

Non aliter Samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo

10 Anacreonta Teium,

qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem
non elaboratum ad pedem.

6 f. deuS, deus: ‘for it is the
god, the god, Ι tell you, who.'
Emphatically stating the cause of
his delay. Intr. 28a.—carmen:
used here apparently of the entire
collection for which his friends
have so long waited (olim promis-
sum). For the order cf: Epist. 2,
Ι, 234 acceptos, regale nomisma,
Pl22·l2·ppos; and Verg. E. 2, 3
inter densas, umbrosa cacumina,
sagos. — iambos : this word seems
to show that the poems in
epodic form are rneant, for
this is the term Horace applies
to them, Epist. Ι, 19, 233 2, 2,
59. Intr. 4.

8. ad umbilicum adducere: a
stick was fastened to the last sheet
of the strip of papyrus paper on
which the book was written ς when
the book was finished the strip
was rolled on this stick, which was
called the umbilicus because it was
in the center of the roll. See Schrei-
ber's Atlas, pl. 90 ff. Therefore the
phrase means, ‘to finish the book.'
So Martial opens the last epigram
of his fourth book ohe iam satis
est, elie libelle. Ι iam pervoezimus
usque ad umbilicos.

9-12. None ofAnacreon's poems
to his favorite Bathyllus are pre-
served, so that we cannot deter-
mine the correctness of this state-
ment. — non aliter : generally used
to return to the main theme after
an illustration‚ not as here to in-
troduce the illustration itself.—·
cava testudine: the sounding box
of the lyre. Cf. C. 1⁷32> 13 f. 0
decus Phoebi et dapibus supremi Ι
grata testudo [θυῖε. - flevit amo—
rem: gave sad expression to his
love. Domitius Marsus says in
his elegy on Tibullus te quoque
Vergilio concitem non aequa, Ti-
bulle, Ι mors iuvenem campos mi‘sit
ad Elysios, Ι ne foret, aut elegi&
molles qni fleret amores, Ι aut ca-
neret forti regia bella pede. Dios-
corides, a writer of the Hellenistic
period, testifies that Anacreon
often became lachrymose over his
love and cups. Antlz. Pal. 7, 31,
3 f. τερπνότατε Μούσῃσιν ΞΑνάκ-
ρεον, ὦ ’πίΒαθύλλῳ Ι χλωρὸν ὑπὲρ
κυλίκων πολλάκι δάκρυ χέας.

12. non elaboratum. etc. z prob-
ably meaning that Anacreon em-
ployed only simple measures for
his love poems.
