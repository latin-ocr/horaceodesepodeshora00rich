woman ς “ she did not shudder at the sword nor shrink at serpent's bite.
She scorned to grace a Roman triumph (21-32).'

The ode begins as a song of exultation on hearing the news of Cleo-
patra's death, which reached Rome in September, 30 B.C. But in v. 21,
after applying the opprobrious fatale monstrum to the queen, Horace
suddenly changes to a feeling of admiration for the heroic courage with
which she faced death and cheated the Romans of half the glory of their
triumph. With this ode should be compared Epod. 9, written in celebra-
tion of the victory at Actium. It is noteworthy that in neither is An-
tony mentioned, the poet sorbearing to glory over a fellow Roman. The
poem is probably modeled on Alcaeus' ode on the death of the tyrant
Myrsilus, in any case the enthusiastic verses with which Horace opens
were suggested by the verses of Alcaeus preserved by Athen. 10, 430 A.
