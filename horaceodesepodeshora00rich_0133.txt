‘ Beloved by the Muses I can throw to the winds all fears of dangers
from abroad. Sweet Muse, weave a chaplet for my La1nia,l pray.
My verse is naught without thee. Celebrate him in Lesbian song.'

The Lamia here addressed has been identified with L. Aelius
Lamia, one of the two sons of Cicero’s friend and supporter, L. Aelius
Lamia who was praetor 43 B.C. (Cic. adfam. 11, 16, 23 pro Sest.
29). Lamia must have been young at the time this ode was written,
sor he was consul in 3 A.D. and praefectus urbi in 32 A.D. He died the
following year. Tacitus, Anu. 6. 27, mentions him, genus illi decorum
vivida senectus; Velleius Paterculus describes him (2, 116, 3), vir an-
tz‘qm'ssimi moris, et priscam gravitatem semper lemnanitate temperans.
The most probable date of composition is that suggested by the refer-
ences in νν. 3-5, as 30 Bc. ς the words fidibus novis, v. 10, cause some
critics to regard this as one of Horace's earliest attempts in Alcaic verse ‚
a view that finds support from the somewhat harsh caesura in v. 11
Lesbio ΙΙ sacrare plectro. Metre, 68.
