fama Marcelli; micat inter omnis
Iulium sidus velut inter ignis
luna minores.

Cf. Mart. 4, 55, 10 grato non pudeat
referre versu. — insigni. . . camena:
‘with the Muse that gives men
fame.'

40 ff. The following illustrations
of ancient virtus and continentia
are C. Fabricius Luscinus, whom
Pyrrhus could neither frighten nor
bribe3 Μ’. Curius Dentatus, who
was equally incorruptible3 and M.
Furius Camillus, who captured
Veii (396 ΒΕ.) and saved Rome
from the Gauls (390 B.c.). All
three, however, are chosen as ex-
amples, ‘not of great deeds, but of
great characters. Their natures
were proverbial.

—intonsis capillis: barbers
were not employed at Rome until
about 300 B.C. (Plin. JV. H. 7,
211)3 and the custom of shaving
the beard and wearing the hair
short became general much later.

43 f. saeva: stern, as training
men to hardihood. · All three wor-
thies were men ofsmall estate, but

of great native worth.—apt0 cum
lare: ‘with humble house befitting
their ancestral farms.'

45 ff. While the direct reference
here is to the young Marcellus.
Octavia“s son, no doubt the name
in this connection would call up
to the Roman mind at once that
M. Claudius Marcellus, who in 222
B.C. won the spolia opima for the
third and last time, captured Syra-
cuse in 212 B.C., and was the first
successful general against Hanni-
bal. —occulto . . . aevo: with crescit,
is growing wille the unmarked
lapse of time. Cf. 2, 2, 5 era-tento
aevo.

47 f. Iulium sidus: the star ofthe
Julian house. This use of sidus
(6 fortune ') would doubtless call to
mind the comet that appeared
shortly after Julius Caesar's rnur-
der (Suet. lul. 88). Cf. Verg. E. 9,
47 ecre Dionaei processit Caesaris
astrum. — inter ignis luna minores :
a reminisceuce of his earlier phrase,
