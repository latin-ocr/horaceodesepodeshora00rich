of Gray's Ode to Adversity‚ while Wordsworth used Gray's poem as a

model for his Ode to Duty.

The expedition referred to in v. 29 f. was undertaken by Augustus
in 27 B.C., when, according to Dio C. 53, 22, ἐξώρμησε μὲν ὡς καὶ ἐς τὴν
Βριττανίαν στρατεύσων, ἐς δὲ δὴ τὰς Γαλατίας ἐλθὼν ἐνταῦθα διέτριψεν.
The following year he again laid plans for the invasion, but was kept
back by an uprising in Spain. In this year, too, preparations were
being- made for the expedition of Aelius Gallus against the Arabians to

which vv. 30—32 refer (cf. ode 29 of this book).

O diva, gratum quae regis Antium,

J

praesens vel 1mo tollere de gradui
mortale co'rpus νέὶ] ευρὲἷῦοε

ruris colonus, te dominam aequbris

1. diva: Fortune, the goddess
who rules at will the vicissitudes
oflife, is here identified with the
Fortunae Antiates. whose temple
at Antium was a famous shrine
until late times. With this shrine
was associated a popular oracle3
therefore the goddesses were called
by Mart. 5, Ι, 3 veridicaesorores.
For representations of the god-
desses on coins, see Baumeister
nos. 606 and 607.

—— gratum: probably equivalent
to dilectum, ⁴ beloved by thee '3 cf.
Ι, 3ο, 2 dilectam Cypron. It may,
however, refer to the beauty of
the place, for Cicero speaking of it
says (ad. Att. 4, 8 a, 1)‚nilzil quie-
tius, nihil alsius, m‘lzil amoenius.

2. praesens . . . tollere: with
power, praesens being equivalent
to potens. Intr. 108. -imo tollere

de gradu: these words might sug-
gest to the Roman reader the
story of Servius Tullius, as the
following superbos . . . triumphos
would surely call to his mind the
case of Aemilius Paullus, the vic-
tor at Pydna, whose two sons died
on the day of his triumph.

3 f, mortale corpus: man's mor-
tal clay. -- vertere: change into.
Cf. Epist. 2, 3, 226 vertereseria ludo.

5 f. te . . . te: note the fre-
quent and emphatic anaphorae in
this ode, by which the goddess
addressed is constantly made
prominent. Intr. 28 c. —ambit:
murts—ruris colonus: the farmer
and the sailor (v. 7) are types of
men especially dependent on the
whims of Fortune. the former for
his crops, the latter for his life as
well as livelihood.
