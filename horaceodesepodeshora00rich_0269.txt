CARMINA [3‚ 8, 8

In this strain Horace invites his patron to celebrate with him the
anniversary of his escape from the falling tree (2, 13). The date is
shown to be March 1, 29 B.C.‚ by the references in vv. 17—23. Cotiso
and the threatening Dacians were subdued in the campaigns of 30-28
Bc. ; the news of the struggle between Phraates and Tiridates for the
Parthian throne (cf. n. to 1, 26, 5) probably reached Rome in January,
29 Bc. Furthermore, at the time of composition Maecenas was clearly
at the head of the state and Octavian absent3 but the latter returned to
, the city in the summer of 29 B.C. All these facts tend to show that the
occasion of the ode was March 1 of that year, and since this is evidently
the first anniversary, that the date of Horace's escape was March 1, 30
B-c. Metre, 69.

Martiis caelebs quid agam KalendiS,

quid velint fiores et acerra turis

plena mirariS, positusque carbo in
caespite viVO,

docte sermones utriusque linguae?

Voveram dulcis epulas et album
Libero caprum prope funeratus

arboris ictU.

1. Martiis . . . Kalendis : the day
of the Matronalza. a festival shared
in by married women only. On
this day the matrons carried their
offerings to the temple of Juno Lu-
cina on the Esquiline, not far from
Maecenas' residence. The festival
is called femineae Kalendae by Ju-
venal, 9, 53. Naturally Maecenas
would be much puzzled over the
preparations of his bachelor (caea
lebs) friend.

2. velint: mean.

4f. caespite vivo: the material
of his improvised altar. Cf. 1 19,
13.—docte: given a bantering em-
phasis by its position, —sor all thy

learning. ——sermones : the lore, lit·
erature. The accusative depends
on docte3 cf. 3, 9, 10 dulczls· docta
modos.—utriusque linguae: Greek
and Latin, the two languages of the
cultivated Roman. Cf. Suet. Aug.
89 in evolvendis utriusque linguae
auctoribus.

eff. voveram: τῖε. long ago. be·
fore all these preparations. The
time is more exactly fixed by the
participle. —epulasz the regular
accompaniment of sacrifice—:11-
bum: as the sacrifice is to one of
the dii superi ——Liberoz the pro-
tector of poets. In 2, 17, 28, how-
ever, it was Faunus who saved him.
