Iracunda diem proferet Iho
matronisque Phrygum classis Achillei:
35 post certas hiemes uret Achaicus
ignis Iliacas domOS.’

33-36. The climax of the proph-
ecy. Up to this point only the
disgraces and dangers of Paris
have been foretold; these verses
definitely announce the fall of'I'roy.
The whole strophe is a reminis-
cence of Hector's prophecy ll. 6,
448 f. ἔσσεται ἦμαρ ὅτ’ ἅν ποτ’ ὀλώλῃ

classis Achillei: as if the entire fleet
shared Achilles' wrath. ——proferetz
delay. —hiemes: equivalent to (172-
nos. Cf. 1,11,4 and n.—ignis:
this use of the trochee where Hor-
ace ordinarily has an irrational
spondee‚ as well as the repetition
of Iliacas after Ilio (v. 33) are cited

of this ode.

Ἴλιος ἱρὴ Ι καὶ Πρίαμος καὶ λαὸς

the mind more than that frenzy with which Dindymene, or Apollo, or

cities. Beware and check thy wrath. Ι too have suffered madness. but
now Ι would recant my cruel lines; forgive, and give me back thy heart.

A palinode which Porphyrio wished. without warrant. to connect
with Tyndaris of the following ode. Neither can it be associated with
any extant epode. Its very extravagance shows that the verses were
not written with serious purpose. Cf. the mock palinode Epacz'. 17. lt
may be a study from the Greek. although Acron's statement. dannatus
est Stesichorum, need mean nothing more than that Horace got the sug-
gestion ofa palinode from the Sicilian poet. The date is uncertain.
although the prosody of v. 21 may indicate that it is one of the earlier
poems. Metro, 68.

O matre pulchra filia pulchrior,
