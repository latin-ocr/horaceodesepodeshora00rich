CARMINA

[2. ι, 26

Iam nunc minaci murmure cornuum
perstringis auris, iam litui strepunt,

iam fulgor armorum fugacis
20 terret equos equitumque voltus.

Audire magnos iam videor duces
non indecoro pulvere sordidos
et cuncta terrarum subacta
praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

25 Iuno et deorum quisquis amicior
Afris inulta cesserat impotens

17. iam nunc: Horace dramati-
cally represents himself as actually
listening to the reading of the his-
tory.

18 f. perstringis: dinnest.—
fulgor armorum: cf. the Homeric
χαλκοῦ στεροπή. and Quint. 10,
30 fulgorem qui terreat, qualis est
ferri, qno mens sz'lllttl visusqxe
praestringitur. — fugacis: pro-
leptic with terret‚—‘throws the
horses into terrified fiight.' —
equos equitumque: cf. Tennyson's
similar assonance ‘while horse
and hero fell.' —— voltus : by zeugma
with terret, dazcnts tlze rz'der's gaze,
etc. To make this refer to the
story that Caesar ordered his sol-
diers at Pharsalus to strike at the
faces of the young nobles in the
opposing army is strained and un-
natural. The phrase is intended
simply to give us a vivid picture
of the panic-stricken horsemen.

21 ff. audire . . . videor: ‘as
you read,' continuing the vividness
of iam nunc, v. 17.—duces . . .,

cuncta . . . subacta: both the
objects of audire—to hear tlze
story of. ’

23 f. cuncta terrarum: cf. 4,
12, 19 amara curarum. —- atrocem z
stzcbborn; in praise, as Sil. Ital.
13, 369 atrox virtus.. —catonis:
the canonized object of praise by
stoics and rhetoricians. Cf. n. to
1> 12ss 35·

25 ff. The mention of Cato re-
calls Thapsus and the long history
of wars in Africa. Juno was the
patron goddess of Carthage‚ in the
Aenez‘d the opponent of Aeneas,
and so hostile to Italy. With
this strophe Horace passes to ex-
pressions of regret for the civil
struggles that form the subject of
Pollio's history.

—cesserat: note the tense.
‘Once the gods had been forced
to withdraw from the doomed
African cities, powerless (impo-
tens) to help them: now they
have had their revenge.' The
Romans had a rite (evocatio) f01
