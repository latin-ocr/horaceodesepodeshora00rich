HORATI

rixae, sive puer furens

impressit memorem dente labris notam.
Non, si me satis audiaS,

speres perpetuum dulcia barbare

15 laedentem oscula, quae Venus

quinta parte sui nectaris imbuit.
Felices ter et amplius,

quos inrupta tenet copula nec malis

divolsus querimoniis

20 suprema citius solvet amor die.

13 f. non: emphatic, like the
English ⁶ No, you would not,' etc.
—dulcia barbare: cf. n. to 1,
5, 9. Intr. 26.

16. quinta parte: simply ‘the
best part) Cf. Meleager Antli.
Pal. 12, 133 φίλημα τὸ νεκτάρεον

We cannot be sure that Horace
uses the phrase as equivalent to
the Pythagorean ἡ πέμπτη οὐσία,

18 if. inrupta: nnbreakable,
rather than ⁶ unbroken ’ς used like
invictus, etc., in the sense of an
adj. in -2'lis, -bilzs — divolsus amor:
cf. 2, 4, 10 ademptus Hector.—
suprema die: lise's last day.

‘ O Ship of State, beware l avoid the open sea3 thou art shattered by
the storm just past. Put into port.'' Quintilian 8, 6, 44 uses this ode
as an illustration of an allegory —at ἀλληγορία qnam inversionem inter—
pretantur, ant alind verbis alind sensu ostendit aut etiam interim con-
trarium. Prius fit genus plerumque continuatis translationibus .· nt
‘ o navis . . . portzmz,⁷ totusque ille ,Horatii locus, qno navem pro re
publica, flnctus et tempestates pro bellis civilibus, portum pro pace
atque concordia dicit) This figure is as old as Theognis, and occurs
