HORATI

Vetabo qui Cereris sacrum

volgarit arcanae sub isdem
sit trabibus fragilemque mecum

solvat phaselon: saepe Diespiter
30 neglectus incesto addidit integrum;
raro antecedentem scelestum
deseruit pede Poena claudo.

des, Frg. 6, 6 ἔστι καὶ σιγᾶς ἀκίν-
δυνον γέρας, which was a favorite
quotation of Augustus. For the
opposite, cf. 1, 18, 16 arcani fides
prodzga. — et z as well. —- vetabo,
etc.: the common personal note,
making the application vivid and
concrete. —- Cereris sacrum: the
Eleusiniam mysteries which could
be disclosed only to the initiate3
here used as a general illustration
of what may not be told. Cf. 1,
18, 11 ff—sub isdem . . . trabi-
bus: cf. Callim. Hymn. in Cerer.
117 f. μὴ τῆνος ἐμὶν φίλος, ὅς τοι
ἀπεχθής, εἴη μηδ’ ὁμότοιχος. ‘ May
that man who has incurred thy
displeasure‚ (goddess), be not my
friend nor share the same house
with me.'—sit: dependent on
vetabo. Cf. the construction with
cava—fragilem: a conventional
epithet (cf. 1, 3, 10), but here em-
phasizing the danger.

29 f. saepe, etc.: for the be-
lies that the righteous run especial
risks in embarking with the wicked,

cf Aesch. Sept. 601 ff. ὡς γαρ
ξυνεισβὰς πλοῖον εὐσεβὴς ἀνὴρ Ι
ναύταισι θερμοῖς ἐν πανουργία τινὶ
Ι ὄλωλεν ἀνδρῶν ξὺν θεοπτύστω
γένει. ‘For the pious man who
has embarked· with sailors hot in
some rascality, has often perished
with the god-detested lot.' Eurip.
Suppl. 226 ff. κοινὰς γὰρ ὁ θεὸς
τὰς τύχας ἡγούμενος Ι τοῖς τοῦ νο-
σοῦντος πήμασιν διώλεσε Ι τὸν οὗ
νοσοῦντα κούδὲν ἠδικηκότα. —neg-
lectus : deb-regarded. — integrum:
cf. Ι, 22, 1 integer vitae.

31 f. raro: emphatically stat-
ing the opposite of saepe above, —
⁴ seldom does the wicked man es-
cape.'— deseruit: given up tlze
pursm't osI—pede claudo: con-
cessive. The thought is a com-
monplace in all literature. Cf.
Eurip. Frg. 979 ἡ Δίκη . . . βραδεῖ
ποδὶ στείχουσα μάρψει τοὺς κακούς,
ὅταν τύχῃ. Tibul. 1, 9, 4 sera
lamen tacitis Poena venit pedibus ,·
and Herbert‚ ‘God's mill* ’grinds
slow, but sure.'
