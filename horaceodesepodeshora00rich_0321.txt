CARMINA

[3, 27, 54

45 Si quis infamem mihi nunc iuvencum
dedat iratae, lacerare ferro et
frangere enitar modo multum amati

cornua monstri.

Impudens liqui patrios penatiS,

50 impudens Orcum moror.

O deorum

si quis haec audiS, utinam inter errem

nuda leones l

Antequam turpis macies decentis
occupet malas teneraeque sucus

45 ff. si quis . . . dedat: a vir-
tual wish.-nunc: in contrast to
the time when she yielded to his
approaches. —lacerare : with cor-
nua3 cf. v. 71 f. below—enitar:
even in her rage she is conscious
of her own weakness. -— modo . . .
amati, etc. : in the meadow she had
wreathed his horns with flowers.

49 f. impudens: she now feels
the shame of her position and fears
possible starvation or slavery—
for her, a princess. Therefore
she prays for death. —liqui patrios
penatis: so Europa exclaims in
Moschus' poem 142 ff. οἴμοι, ἐγὼ
μέγα δή τι δυσάμμορος, ἤ ῥα τε
δῶμα Ι πατρὸς ἀποπρολιποῦσα καὶ
ἑσπομένη βοῒ τῷδε Ι ξείνην ναυτι-
λίην ἐφέπω καὶ πλάζομαι οἴη,
, ‘Alas for me, and alas again, for
mine exceeding evil fortune, alas
for me that have left my father's
house, and following this bull, on
a strange sea-faring Ι go, and
wander lonely' (Lang). — Orcum

moror: l keep death waiting,
(when Ι ought to seek him).

51 f. si quis: equivt lent to
quisquis. Cf. 3, 24, 25 and n.—
inter: Intr. 33.—nuda: defense-
less. ’

53 ff. With the ancient con-
cept of life after death as a continu-
ation of the present, it was natural
to believe that in the other world
the body appeared in the same
form in which it left this. The
cases of Dido and Deiphobus. Α.
6, 450 and 494, are familiar illus-
trations. Also Stat. Sz‘lv. 2, 1,
154 ff. says of the death of a fav-
orite boy gratum est.fata, tamen,
quad mm mors lenta incendis 1 ese-
dit puerile decus manesque snb--
ivit 1 integer et nulla temeratus
corpora damna. It was natural
then that Europa should pray for
death' before her beauty had faded.

53 ff. decentis: comely‚· cf. 1,
4, 6.-sucus: cf. Ter. Eun. 318

of a girl, color verus„ corpus soli- ,
