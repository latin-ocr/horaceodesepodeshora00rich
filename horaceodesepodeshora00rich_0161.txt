vix una sospes navis ab ignibus,
mentemque lymphatam Mareotico
15 redegit in veros timores
Caesar, ab Italia volantem

remis adurgenS, accipiter velut
mollis columbas aut leporem citus
venator in campis nivalis
20 Haemoniae, daret ut catenis

fatale monstrum.

Quae generosius

perire quaerens nec muliebriter
expavitensem nec latentis
classe cita reparavit oras;

13. vix una sospes: tlze fact
tlzat hardly α single slzip escczped.
As a matter of fact Cleopatra es-
caped with sixty ships, while An-
tony's fleet was burned. It may
be that the first news of the battle
reported the destruction of Cleopa-
tra's ships as well.

14 ff. Her drunken madness was
changed into genuine terror by Cae-
sar's pursuit.—lymphatam: νυμ-
φόληπτος, distracled. The word
owes its origin to the belief that
those who caught sight of water

accipiter velut: a Homeric figure.
Cf. sl. 22, 139 f. ἠύτε κίρκος ὄρε-

19 f. nivalis Haemoniae : z'.e.Th es-
saly in winter, the hunting season.
-monstrum quae: construction ac-
cording to sense. Cf. Cic. adfam.
Ι, 9, 15 illa furia muliebrium re-

21 f. At this point Horace sud-
denly changes to admiration for
Cleopatra's courage, that made her
prefer death to capture—genero-
sius perire: to die a nobler death. —-
nec muliebriter expavit: nor like
a woman did she sear. Plutarch
(Ant. 79) says that on the approach
of Proculeius. Octavian's emissary,
Cleopatra tried to stab herself.

23 f. nec latentis, etc.: there is
