HORATI

mercede pacta Laomedon mihi
castaeque damnatum Minervae
cum populo et duce fraudulento⁰

25 Iam nec Lacaenae splendet adulterae
famosus hospes nec Priami domus
periura pugnacis Achivos

21 ff. exiquo: fixing the time
of damnatum v. 23. Troy was
doomed from the day of Laome-
don's default3 iudicium Paridzlr
- spretaeque iniuria formae were
then only one of the causes of
Troy's fast—deos: Apollo and
Poseidon served Laomedon a year 3
according to the Homeric form of
the story (Il. 21, 441 ff.), Posei-
don built for him the walls of
Troy while Apollo pastured his
herds3 but Laomedon refused to
pay the price agreed on for the
service. Other forms of the myth
make Apollo Neptune's partner in
building the walls—castae Mi-
nervae: cf. 1, 7, 5 intactae Palla-
dis. —ducez Laomedon.

25 ff. iam nec: no longer now.
—splendetz reproducing the Ho-
meric κάλλεΐ τε στίλβων καὶ
εἵμασι ll. 3, 392. —adulteraez dat.

with splendet, in tlte eyes of, etc. —
famosus: Paris was the notorious
example of such infamous action
toward his host. -periura: re-
ferring to Laomedon's broken
promise—refringit: breaks and
drz'ves back.

29 ff. ductum: prolonged. The
length of the war was due to divi-
sion among the gods. — resedit:
lzas subsz'ded, like the waves of a
stormy sea—protinus: from this
moment. — nepotem z Romulus,
her descendant, hitherto hateful
(invisum) to her because the child
of a Trojan mother. —Troica sa-
cerdos: Rhea Silvia. Horace here,
as in 1, 2, 17 ff.‚ follows the older
tradition which made her the
daughter of Aeneas. Notice that
here, as in v. 25 f.‚ Juno will not
call the objects of her resentment
by name.
