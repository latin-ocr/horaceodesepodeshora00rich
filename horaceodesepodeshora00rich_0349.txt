rwey, and at last engages in battle
with snakes (dracones) that sight
back. Horace may have had in
:nind the description ofthe struggle
between the eagle and snake, ll.
12, 200 ff. imitated by Verg. Α.
11, 751 ff.

13 ff. laetis: luxuriant.—ma-
tris ab ubere: editors are not
agreed whether these words refer
to caprea or leonem. lt is proba-
ble that the second alternative is
right, and that lacte depulsum is
to be considered as expressing a
single idea, weanea'. Vergil has
(j. 3, 187 depulsus ab ubere and
E. 7, 15 depulsos a lacte . . .
urgues. Horace's expression is
then tautological but not un-
natural. We may render, [αἰεί]

weaned from lais tawny mother's
dags.

16. peritura vidit: notice the
force of .the juxtaposition——the
fawn sees the lion and recognizes
its own fate at the same moment.

17 f. videre: the anadiplosis
makes talem unnecessary. Intr.
28 b.— Raetis: equivalent to Rae-
ticis. —quibus ε the relative 3 trans-
late, their. The indirect question
is introduced by unde. The refer-
ence here to an archaeological
discussion is rnost inopportune,
and some have wished to regard
the verses as the invention of a
later writer. It is more probable
that Horace’s usual good taste
deserted him. The passage may
be an attempt to imitate a Pin-
daric digression. ln any case we
must remember that the ode was
made to order, and that such a
task was not inspiring to Horace's
muse.

19 f. deductus: the participle,
as frequently, contains the main
idea. —- per omne tempus: i.e.
from the mythological period to
the present time. —- Amazonia
securi: see Baumeister 1, pp. 60,
63 for illustrations of this form
