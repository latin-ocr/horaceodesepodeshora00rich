HORATI

dextras obarmet‚ quaerere distuli,
nec scire fas est omnia), sed diu
lateque victrices catervae
consiliis iuvenis revictae

²⁵ sensere quid mens rite, quid indoles
nutrita faustis sub penetralibus
posset, quid Augusti paternus
in pueros animus NeroneS.

Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis3
30 est in iuvenciS, est in equis patrum
virtUS, neque imbellem feroces
progenerant aquilae columbam:

of axe. — obarmet: coined by
Horace.

22 f. nec scire ἵεις, etc. ε said al-
most with impatience, —-‘don't

ask me how this custom has been
handed down. Man should not
try to know everything.'—- diu
lateque: modifying victrices. The
reference is to the successes of
the Vindelici before they were
checked by Drusus.

24. consiliis: wise strategy.—
revictae: defeated in their turn.

25 f. rite . . . nutrita: with both
mens and indoles, z'ntellzgence and
maranen—faustis . . . penetrali-
bus: the phrase is chosen, like rite
above, to suggest the sacred char-
acter of the training the young
princes received in the Emperor's
house. So Velleius 2, 94, 1 says
of the training of Tiberius under
Augustus, innutritus caelestium
praeceptorum dzlcciplim's.

28. Nerones : Tiberius and
Drusus —the latter was born after
his mother was divorced from Ti.
Claudius Nero and married to Oc-
tavianus—were both treated by
their stepfather as his own sons
(cf. paternus animus).

29 ff. fortes, etc.: good birth
is the first essential. The senti-
ment of the verse is a common-
place. Cf. eg. Eurip. Frg. 75, 2
ἐσθλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν ἐσθλὰ γίγνεσθαι
τέκνα, κακῶν δ’ ὅμοια τῇ φύσει τῇ
τοῦ πατρός. - fortibus et bonis: a
frequent commendatory expres-
sion. Cf. Epist. 1, 9, 13 scribe
tui gregis lzzmc et fortem crede
bonumque. —est . . . est: em-
phatic, πο doubt there is. At the
same time the sentence is logically
concessive with reference to the
following strophe. —imbellem fe-
roces: juxtaposed as 1, 6, 9 tenues

grandia. Intr. 26.
