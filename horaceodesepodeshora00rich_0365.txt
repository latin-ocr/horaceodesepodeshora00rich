CARMINA

[4, 7, 28

Quis scit an adiciant hodiernae crastina summae

tempora di superi ?

Cuncta manus avidas fugient herediS, amico

ιο quae dederis animo.

Cum semel occideris et de te splendida Minos

fecerit arbitria,

non, Torquate, genUS, non te facundia, non te

restituet pietas

²5 Infernis neque enim tenebris Diana pudicum

liberat Hippolytum,

nec Lethaea valet Theseus abrumpere caro

vincula Pirithoo.

Cypris; in Acheron, maiden, we
shall be only bones and ashes.'

17 f. Cf. 1, 9, 13 ff.3 Epist. 1,
4, 12 ff. inter spem curamque,
timores inter et iras Ι omnem crede
diem tibi dilulecse supremum5 Ι
grata superveniet quae mm spera-
bitur hora. Also Anac. 15, 9 f.
τὸ σήμερον μέλει μοι, τὸ δ’ αὔριον
τίς οἶδεν. -summaez cf. 1, 4, 15.

19 ff. The lesson of the preced-
ing—heredis: the dreaded heir,
the thought of whom haunts every
man who gathers riches. Cf. n. to
2, 3, 193 also 2, 14, 253 3⁷ 24, 62·
—dederis animo: essentially the
same as genium curare 3, 17, 14.
The adjective amico is added in im-
itation of the Homeric φίλον ἦτορ.

21. semel: cf. n. to 1,24, 16.
—splendida: stately5 properly the
characteristic of Minos' court, trans-
ferred to his decrees. Intr. 99.

23 f. genus, facundia, pietas:

the first two at least applied to
Torquatus, for he was a member
of the noble Manlian gens and
was an advocate of some eminence.
Note the cadence of the verse.

25 ff. Two mythological illus-
trations. Observe that pudicum
and caro are set over against each
other, and express the qualities
for which Hippolytus and Piri-
thous were famous—the first for
his chastity in refusing the ad-
vances of Phaedra, his step-mother,
the second for his friendship with
Theseus. Horace follows the
Greek legend according to which
Artemis could not save her devo—
tee from death: but the myth
among the Romans made Diana
restore Hippolytus to life and trans-
fer him under the name of Virbius
to her grove by Lake Nemi (Verg.
A. 7, 768 ff. ς Ovid. Met. 15.
548 ff.).—Pirit1100:cf.n.to 3‚4, 80.
