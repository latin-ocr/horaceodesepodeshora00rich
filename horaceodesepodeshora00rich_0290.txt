HORATI

15 reges muneribus; munera navium
saevos inlaqueant duceS.

Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam
maiorumque fames; iure perhorrui
late conspicuum tollere verticem,

ze MaecenaS, equitum decus.

Quanto quisque sibi plura negaverit,

ab dis plura feret.

Nil cupientium

nudus castra peto et transfuga divitum
partis linquere gestiO,

15 f. muneribus: munera: with
brz'bes,· yeS, brz'bes. [say. lntr. 281).
—navium duces: some see here a
reference to Menas (or Mene-
dorus), the freedman of Cn. Pom—
pey and admiral of Sextus Pom-
pey. who in 38 Bc. deserted to
Octavianus: afterwards he re-
turned to his earlier allegiance,
only to desert again—saevos:
stern though tlzey be. —inlaqueant :
ensnare.

17 f. crescentem, etc.: a com-
mon sentiment. Cf. Theoc. 16,
64 f. ἀνήριθμος δέ οἱ εἴη ἄργυρος,
αἰεὶ δὲ πλεόνὼν ἔχοι ἵμερος αὐτόν,
‘His be unnumbered wealth, but
may a longing for more ever pos-
sess him.’ Iuv. 14, 139 crescit
amm> nummi, quantum ipsa pe-
cunia crevit.—fames: cf. Epist.
1, 18, 23 argenti sitis importuna
famesque3 Verg. Α. 3, 57 auri
mera fames.

19 f. late conspicuum: prolep-
tic, So that it could be seen asar.
—equitum decus: Maecenas was

a good example of the moderation
Horace is urging: although pos·
sessed of great wealth and influ-
ence, he modestly declined political
preferment. Cf. n. to 1, 1, 1 3 20, 5.

21 f. plura, . . . plura: the
context in this paradox shows the
meaning. By the first plura Hor-
ace means money and the unes-
sential things which it procures,
‘this world's goods'3 by the sec-
ond, the real goods which cannot
be bought, but are gifts frorn
heaven,—a contented mind and
ability to find happiness in simple
things.—nil cupientium: and so
content. Cf. Maximian. 1, 54 et
rerum dominus nil cupiendo fui.

23 f. nudus: zze. leaving allen-
cumbrances of wealth and luxury.
—transfuga : continuing the figure
of the soldier eager to leave the
party (partis) to which he now
belongs, and flee to the opposite
camp—divitum: and there-fore
discontent, contrasted with nil
cupientium.
