4, 1] HORATI

praemium adlecti, qnos orcinos vulgus vocabat) ad modum pristinum
et splendorem redegit dicabus lectionibus.

Horace was himself the son of a freedman‚ but nothing could be
more offensive to him than the straining and display of such parvenus.
His own attitude is clearly seen in S. 1, 6, where his calm tone shows
that he is discussing a general question. The fierceness of this epode
seems to warrant the belief that he has some definite individua} in
mind, who probably was easily recognized by his contemporaries.
All efforts to identify him are useless. Many of the MSS. have
the inscription: ad Sextum Menam Libertinum. Vedium Rufum
ex servitute miratur usurpasse equestrem dignitatem usque ad tribu-
natum militum. The first part refers to Menas, or Menodorus‚ a
freedman of Sextus Pompey who twice deserted to Octavian. The
name Vedius was probably suggested to the earlier commentators by a
passage in Cicero's letter to Atticus (ad Act. 6, 1, 25) which was written
at Laodicea in 54 Bc, but not published until some time in the first
century A.D. hoc ego ex P. Vedio, magno nebulone (rascal), sea' Pompeii
tamen familiari, audivi.- laic Vedius venit milii obviam cum duobus
essedis (English gigs) et raeda (carryall) equis iuncta et lectica et
familia magna, pro qna, si Curio legem pertulerit, HS centenos pendat
necesse est‚· erat praeterea cynocephalus (a dog—headed ape) in essedo
nec deerant onagri (wild asses) : numquam vidi hominem nequiorem.
The possibility remains, however, that this epode is nothing more than
an exercise after Archilochus (Intr. 4). The date of composition is
probably 36 B.c. See n. to 17-19. Metre‚ 74.

Lupis et agnis quanta sortito obtigit,
tecum mihi discordia est,

1 f. The enmity of wolves and
sheep has been proverbial in liter-
ature from the Homeric poems
down. Cf. ll. 22, 262 ff. ὡς οὐκ
ἔστι λέουσι καὶ ἀνδράσιν ὅρκια
πιστά, Ι οὐδὲ λύκοι τε καὶ ἄρνες
ὁμόφρονα θυμὸν ἔχουσιν Ι ἀλλὰ
κακὰ φρονέουσι διαμπερὲς ἀλλή-
λοισιν, Ι ὧς οὐκ ἔστ’ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ
φιΧήμεναι, and Ovid. lb. 43 pax
erit lzaec nobis, donec milli vita

manebit, Ι cum pecore infirmo quae
solet esse lupis. — sortito : in origin
an ablative absolute, it is equiv-
alent to sorte, lege naturae, i.e.
‘the allotment made by nature'3
this meaning clearly appears in
S. 2, 6. 93 terrestria quando mor-
talis animas vivunt sortita, also
Plaut. llserc. 136 at tibi sortito

id optigrzt. said in answer to the cry
perimus.
