cARMINA [4, 3, 10

Romans gladly gave him the recognition he deserved. He had indeed
obtained the object of his ambitions expressed in C. Ι, 1. ln the present
ode he shows his gratitude to the Muse for his success3 and this feeling
is expressed, not in boasting, but with a humility which shows that
Horace felt his skill to be due to some power beyond himself. The ode
has evident reminiscences of Ι, 1 in the contrast between the aims of
ordinary men and the quiet life of the poet. Metre, 71.

Quem tn, Melpomene, semel
nascentem placido lumine videriS‚
illum non labor Isthmius
clarabit pugilem, non equus impiger
5 curru ducet Achaico
victorem, neque res bellica Deliis

ornatum foliis ducem,
quod regum tumidas contuderit minaS,

ostendet Capitolio ;

10 sed quae Tibur aquae fertile praefluunt

1 ff. The same idea is expressed-

in Greek poetry‚ eg. by Hesiod
Theog. 81 ff. ὅντινα τιμήσωσι Διὸς
κοῦραι μεγάλοιο Ι γεινόμενόν τε
ἴδωσι διοτρεφέων βασιλήων, Ι τῷ
μὲν ἐπὶ γλώσσῃ γλυκερὴν χείουσιν
ἐέρσην (dew), τοῦ δ’ ἕπε’ ἐκ στόμα-
τος ῥεῖ μείλιχα.

—Melpomenez cf. 3, 30, 16.—
semel : but once.—placido lumine:
cf. Alciphr. 3, 44 εὐμενεστέροις
ὄμμασιν ἐκεῖνον εἶδον οἱ Χάριτες.

3 ff. labor: the Greek πόνος.
—Isthmius: cf. 4, 2, 17 and n.—
pugilem, equus: the same types 4,
2, 18.——Achaico: tle. Greek5 con-

trasted with the Roman triumph,

which follows. — res bellica : deeds
in war. Cf. res ludicra, ‘ comedy‚'
Epist 2, 1, 180. - Deliis . . .

341

foliis: the laurel‚ a crown of which
was worn by the triumphing gen-
eral. Cf. 3, 30, 15 Delphica lauro,
4, 2, 9 laurea Apollinari.

8f. tumidas: contrasted with
contuderit. cruslzed down. The
adjective was adopted by Seneca,
H. Ο. 927 depone tumidas pectoris
laesi naiman—minas: cf. 2, 12,
12 regum minacium. — Capitolio:
the end of the triumphal proces—
sion.

10 f. Horace uses the streams
and groves of his bclox‘ed Tivoli
as typical of the haunts of the
Muses and their devotees; he also
secures through their associations
with himself an easy transition
to his own case—quae Tibur
aquae, etc.: cf. 1, 7, 12 ff. ——praeg
