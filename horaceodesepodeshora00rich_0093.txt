13 ff. This strophe summarizes
the twenty—fourth hook of the lliad,
in which is told how Priam, under
Hermes' direction, carne into the
Greek camp bringing great ransom
for Hector's body. how he kissed
the hand 'of his son's slayer. and
carried back the corpse. This ex-
ample of Hermes' power to protect
and aid mankind forms an easy tran-
sition from the story of his elever
’ theft (7—12) to a mention of his
highest functions‚ as ψυχοπομπός
(17-20).

—quin et: regularly used in

transition to a more striking state-¹

ment, or. as here, to a higher theme. ;

Hector's body. ——Thessalos ignis:
specializing the watch-fires as be-
longing to Achilles' troops.—fe-
tellit: went all annoticed past.

presented by Apollo, with which
Mercury rules men and the shades
alike. Cf. ll. 24, 343 f. εἵλετο δὲ

ὧν ἐθέλει, τοὺς δ’ αὖτε καὶ ὑπνώοντας
