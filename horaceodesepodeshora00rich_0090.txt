and have no anxiety for what may
come on the morrow?'—fuge:
slzztn, cf. 2, 4, 22 fitge suspicari.
— fors: personified, Dame For-
tune. — dierum: connect with quem
. . . cumque. For the tmesis, cf.
1, 6, 3. ——lucro appone : in ori-
gin a commercial expression3
‘carrying to the profit account.⁷
Cf. Ovid, Trz'st. 1, 3, 68 in lucro
est quae datur hora milti.

16. puer: ‘while thou art
young.'—tu: in disjunctive sen-
tences the subject pronoun is
often reserved for the second
member as here, giving emphasis
to the charge. Cf. Epz‘sl. 1, 2,
63 lzzmc frenis, lmnc tu compesce
calena3 and Iuv. 6. 172 parce
precor, Paean, et tu depone sagit-
tas.

forceful juxtaposition3 cf. n. to 1,

Martius and the public squares
(areae) were natural trysting
places. In our climate we have
little idea of the way in which
Italian life, from business to love-
making, is still carried on in the
squares (piazze) of the towns
and cities.-—lenes . . . susurri:
cf. Prop. 1, 11, 13 blandos audire
susurros.

21 ff. nunc et: the anaphora
weakens the violence of the
zeugma by which this strophe is
connected with repetantur, be
claimed,· the opposite of reddere.
cf. n. on reponens, v. 6, above.
The skillful arrangement of the
verses is striking and cannot be
reproduced in an uninflected lan-
guage; like an artist, Horace adds
to his picture stroke after stroke,
until it is complete. Each idea in
the first verse has its complement
in the second: —

latentis proditor intimo
pmillae risus ab angulo
