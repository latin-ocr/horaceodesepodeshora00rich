epigram of Crinagoras‚ Antlz. Pal. 16, 40 γείτονες οὐ τρισσαὶ μοῦνον

Καί αι πάντων 'ITin'UL' Τί γὰρ ἀνδρί ΤΟσωδΕ Ι ἀρκέσει Εἷς ΕΤαρων μυρίον
εὐφροσύνην; Ι νῦν δέ σε καὶ τούτων κρέσσων ἐπι μείζον’ ἀέξοι Ι Καῖσαρ·
τις κείνου χωρὶς ἅρηρε τύχη. ‘Not tlnee goddesses of Fortune alone
should be thy neighbors‚ Crispus, for thy rich and generous heart, but
rather every kind of Fortune in every event should be thine. For what
can be enough for such a man to reward his endless kindness toward
his friends? Nay, now may Caesar who is mightier than these, exalt

The ode is an expansion on the Stoic paradOX, ‘the wise alone is
rich.' The date of composition is probably fixed by 17 ff. as soon

after 27 B.c. Metre‚ 69.
