cf. Dobson*s verses to Longfel-
low, ‘Not to be tuneless in old
age! Ah surely blest his pil-
grimage, Ι Who, in his Winter's
snow,1Still sings with note as
sweet and clear Ι As in the morn-

but among garlands ever spend
my days3 and still when 1 am

‘ We are asked fora song. Come, my lyre, if ever we have sung light
strains that shall live, now raise a true Latin song, like those Alcaeus sang
‘of old. In war ancl shipwreck still he sang of wine and love. Sweet
shell‚ beloved by Jove supreme, solace of toil, hear me when I duly call.’

This ode may have been written as a prelude of some serious ode or
collection such as the first six of the third book, to which ‘Latinum
carmen’ may refer. Horace quotes his great model to show that songs
oflove and wine are not inconsistent with serious poetry. Metre, 69.

Poscimur. Si quid vacui sub umbra

lusimus tecum, quod et hunc in annum

vivat et pluris, age dic Latinum,
barbite‚ carmen,

5 Lesbio primum modulate civi,

1. poscimur. Horace's friends
may have asked him to write a
thoroughly Roman ode and not
simply studies from Greek models.
—vacuiz with leght beart, free
from care and anxieties.

2 f. lusimus: appropriate, with
vacui, to light poetry. Cf. Verg.
E. 1, 10 ludere qnae vellem calamo
permisit agresti. - vivat: shall

live. Cf. Epist. 1, 19, 2f. nulla
placere diu nec vivere carmina
possunt Ι quae scribuntur aquae
potorz'bus.—dic: of instrumental
music3 cf. Cic. de div. 2, 122 si
velim canere vel voce vel fidibus.
5. Not that Alcaeus (Lesbio . . .
civi) was the first to play the lyre,
but the first to perfect lyric poetry.
— civi ε referring to Alcaeus' patri-
