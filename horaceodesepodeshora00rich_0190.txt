Orpheus mourned for his lost Eu-
ridice, Verg. G. 4, 466 te veniente
die, te decedente canebat. Cf. Hel-
vius Cinna's lines, te matutinus
flentem conspexit Eous Ι et flentem
paula vidit past Hesperus alem,-
and Tennyson's Mariana, ‘Her
tears fell with the dews of even3 1
Her tears fell ere the dews were
dried.'—amores : τῖε. his elegies. —
rapidum: placed in contrast with
fugiente. It is a stock epithet of
the sun. Cf. Mimn. 10, 5 ὠκέος
Ἠελίοιο ἀκτῖνες, and Verg. G. 1,
92 rapidive potentia solz’s.

13 ff. ter aevo functus: Nestor,

ἐφθίαθ’, οἵ οἱ πρόσθεν ἅμα τράφεν

δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν. Cf. Cic.
C. M. 31 tertiam enim aetatem homi-
num videbat.—amabilem: placed
here with adversative force, z‘n spite
of all his loveliness. Cf. impubem
(v. 1 5), a mere child. The two adjec-
tives doubtless are chosen as apply-
ing also to Mystes, whom Valgius

nos: when, in the Odyssey, Te
lemachus and his companion visit
Nestor at his home in Pylus, they
find him cheerful in spite of the
loss of his son Antilochus, whom
Memnon slew. —Troilonz Priam's
young son, whom Achilles caught
and slew near a spring. This was
a favorite scene with vase painters
ofthe early fifth century (Baum. p.
1901 f.). Troilus' sister Polyxena
is frequently represented as wit-
nessing his death. His fate was in
poets the type of early death3 cf.
eg. Verg. Α. 1, 474 ff, where indeed
Vergil is describing a wall painting,
and Chaucer, T. and C. 5, 1806
‘dispitously him slough the fiers
Achille.'

17. desine...querellarum: this
construction with the genitive of
separation is in imitation of Greek
usage with λήγω, παύομαι, etc. Cf.
3, 17, 16 operum solutis ; 3, 27, 69
abstineto irarum.
