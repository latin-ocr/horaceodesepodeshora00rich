HORATI

fratresque tendentes opaco
Pelion imposuisse Olympo,

Sed quid Typhoeus et validus Mimas,
aut quid minaci Porphyrion statu,

the Hecatoncheires‚ who in the
common form of the myth guard
for Jove the Titans whom he has
hurled into Tartarus. But here
Horace includes them among the
monstrous‚ and therefore evil, pow-
ers that assail the majesty of right
and wisdom. The violence done

one of Horace's audience, and the
allegory would be evident to all.
horrida bracchiis: with their bris-
tling arms.
