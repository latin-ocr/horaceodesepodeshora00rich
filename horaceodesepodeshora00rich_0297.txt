Epist. Ι, 16, 25 bella tibi terra pug-
nata marique—sacro . . . sub Ilio:
the Homeric Ἴλιος ἱρή. Neuter

5 ff. The really important ques-
tions of the moment. The carouse
is a συμβολή, one to which each
participant makes a contribution.
—Chium: the Chian was a choice
wine—quis aquam, etc.: to mix
with the wine, for the evening is
chill. —quo praebente, etc.: cf. S.
1, 5, 38 Murena praebente domum,

unmixed wine.'

—noctis mediae: the carouse
shall last until morning.

11 f. Murenae: apparently the
Licinius Murena of 2, 103 but we
do not know from any other source
that he was ever augur.—tribus
aut novem, etc. : the sextarius was
divided into twelve cyathi. Here
the wine is to be mixed either three
parts wine to nine parts water for
the weaker brethren, or nine parts
wine to three parts water for the
stronger heads. — commodis: lo
