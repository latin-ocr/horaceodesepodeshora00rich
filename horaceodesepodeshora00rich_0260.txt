HORATI

interque maerentis amicos
egregius properaret exsul.

Atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus
50 tortor pararet ε non aliter tamen
dimovit obstantis propinquos
et populum reditus morantem

quarn si clientum longa negotia
diiudicata lite relinqueret,
55 tendens Venafranos in agros
aut Lacedaemonium Tarentum.

erence to removisse, posuisse.—
consilio ε connect with firmaret. —-
interque: and then through the
mz'dst of—egregius: cf. n. to Ι, 6,
11. With the oxymoron, cf. 3, 3, 38 f.
Notice that two points are brought
out in this strophe : Regulus’ moral
courage in inducing the senate to
accept his proposal, and the sels-
sacrifice which this involved.

49 ff. atqui: and yet, καί τοι.
Cf. 1, 23, 9.—sciebat: ke knew
all tlte while. —non aliter . . .
quarn si: as undz'sturbed . . . as
if. — tortor, etc. ε the tortures to
which Regulus was subjected, like
the whole story of the embassy‚
may be inventions of a later time.
Cf. n. to v. 13 ff. — obstan-tis: who
tried to lzz'nder him—reditus:
plural for euphony.

53 ff. longa : wearz'some.—diiu-
dicata lite: the Roman patronus
of the Republic was bound to aid
and protect his dientes,- whether
the suit here is conceived of as one
which Regulus decided as arbitra-

tor or one in which he defended
his client's interests in court is not
clear. —tendens : taking his way,
into the country for rest and re-
freshment. — Venafranos agros . . .

Tarentum: cf. 2, 6, 12-16 and nn. ,

Note the contrast between the

earlier part of the ode and this ,

quiet close. The ode is one of

Horace's noblest3 its national
characteristics are well summed
up by Andrew Lang in his Letters
to Dead Autlmrs, p. 191 f. ‘None
but a patriot could have sung that
ode on Regulus, who died, as our
hero died on an evil day, for the
honor of Rome, as Gordon for
the honor of England. . . . We
talk of the Greeks as your teach-
ers. Your teachers they were„
but that poem could only have
been written by a Roman. The
strength, the tenderness, the noble
and monumental resolution and
resignation—these are the gifts
of the lords of human things, the

· masters of the world.’
