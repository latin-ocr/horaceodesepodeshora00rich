CARMINA

[2. 12, 28

ludentem nitidis virginibus sacro
20 Dianae celebris die.

Num tu quae tenuit dives Achaemenes

aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes

permutare velis crine Licymniae,
plenas aut Arabum domOS‚

25 cum flagrantia detorquet ad oscula
cervicem, aut facili saevitia negat
quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,

interdum rapere occupet?

19 f. nitidis: tle. in holiday
dress. —Dianae . . . die : the
chorus which sang and danced in

bris: thronged with celebrants.

East could purchase from you one
lock of her hair.'—Achaemenes:
the founder of the royal house of
Persia. Cf. 3, 1, 44. — Mygdonias:

kisses, she would take more satis-
faction in having them stolen from
her than the one (zze. you, Mae-
cenas) who begs them would
delight to get them3 indeed she
would sometimes begin by steal-
ing them from γοα) Cf. Tibul.
Ι, 4, 53 ff . rapias tum cara licebit Ι
oscula: pugnabit. sed famen apta
(iabin-1 rapta dabit primo, mox
