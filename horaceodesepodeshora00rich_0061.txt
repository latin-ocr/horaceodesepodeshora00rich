CARMINA [1‚ 2, 6

illustrate the growth of this identification‚ at least in the Campanian
city. In three of these records (C.l.L. 10, 885—887), the first two of
which can be dated 14 B.C., the persons attached to the cult of Mer-
cury are called ministri [Mercurii Maiae; then no. 888, of uncertain
date, has ministri Augusti lllercurz' Μαίαες and finally nos. 890-
910, beginning with 2 B.C., have only ministri Augusti. Later, the
conception of Augustus as identical with Apollo prevailed.

The date of composition falls between the return of Octavian from
the East in 29 B.c. (cf. v. 49, magnos—trz‘mnphos) and Jan. 13th, 27 B C ,
when his imperium was renewed, and he received the new title, Augus-
tus. The most probable date is late in 28 B.C., when Octavian's
suggestion of giving up his power (Dio C. 53, 4, 9) may well have
awakened fears of the return of civil strife. Metre, 69.
