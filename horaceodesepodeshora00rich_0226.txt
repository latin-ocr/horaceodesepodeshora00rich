2, 20, 1] HORATI

20

In an allegory Horace prophesies his own immortality. He is not to
die, but shall be transformed into a swan and fly from the Stygian wave
to the confines of the world. His description of the change which he
feels coming on him is given in such detail (9-12) as to rob the poem, for
the modern reader at least, of much of the charm that it would otherwise
possess. The identification of the poet's song with the flight of a bird
was common in antiquity, as it is to—day. Cf. eg. Theog. 237 ff„ 1097 f. 3
Pind. N. 6, 47 ff.; Eurip. Frg. 911 N.; Theoc. 7, 47.

Apparently Horace wrote this ode after his collection in three books
was practically complete, intending it as an epilogue to his lyric verse.
Fortunately his second attempt, which now stands at the end of the third
book, was far superior, so that he relegated these verses to their present
position. Metre, 68.

sanguis parentum, non ego quem vocaS,

κῆ. non usitata, etc.: no ardi-
nary or weak,· for his verse was in
new forms and his poetic gift was
great. —biformis : in a literal sense,
both bard and bird. The famili-
arity of the ancients with the idea
of combining human forms with
those of beasts, eg. the centaur,
minotaur (called biformis Verg. A.
6, 25) no doubt gave thern a differ-
ent feeling for Horace's concept
than we can possibly have. Por-
phyrio too subtly interprets the
adjective to mean writer in both
hexameter and lyric measure.—
liquidum: clear, as Verg. G. 1, 404
apparet liquido sublimis in aere

le‘sus. —vates z in its original sense
ofinspired hard. Cf. n. to 1, 1, 35.

4. invidia maior: the phrase
may have been borrowed from the
Greek. Cf. Callim. Engr. 21, 4 ὁ
δ’ ἤεισεν κρέσσονα βασκανίης. In
his earlier years, before his position
as lyric poet was established, Hor-
ace suffered from the jibes of those
who envied him Maecenas' favor.
Cf. S. 1, 6, 46 f. quem rodunt om-
nes libertino patre natum, 1 nunc
quia sim tibi, Maecenas, convicfflr.
When his fame was certain he took
no little satisfaction in scorning
those who once scorned him. Cf.
2, 16, 39 f.
