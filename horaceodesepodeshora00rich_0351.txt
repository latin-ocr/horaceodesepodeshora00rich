doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
rectique cultus pectora roborant*;

33 ff. ‘Yet correct training is
essential.' Notice the emphasis
on doctrina, recti cultus, indeco-
rant—sed: and yet.—cultus:
nurture. With the sentiment of
the two verses cf. Epist. 2, 3,
408 ff‚; Cic. pro Arde. 15 idem
ego contendo, cum ad naturam
eximiam atque inlustrem acces-
serit ratio quaedam conscffinati-
oque doctrinae, tum illud nescio
quid praeclarum ac singulare
solere exsistere. Quint. [nst. 12,
2, 1 virtus etiamsi quosdam im-
'petus ex natura sumit, lamen
perficienda doctrina est.

35 f. utcumque: as soon as.
Cf. 1, 17, 10.-—-defecere: definite
perfect. — bene nata: the general-
izing plural 3 translate, that wlzicli
is naturally good.

37 ff. The chief theme of the
ode—‘the glorious ancestry of
Drusus.' In 207 B.C. Hannibal
was waiting at Canusium in Apulia
for the arrival of his brother Has-
drubal with *a large army. Has-

drubal had already crossed the
Alps when the consul M. Claudius
Nero, who was watching Hanni-
bal, took 7000 picked men and
without the enemy's knowledge
marched rapidly to the north to
re'e'nforce his colleague‚ M. Livius,
from whom also Drusus was de-
scended by his mother's side.
The two consuls defeated the
enemy at the river Metaurus, and
Claudius Nero returned quickly
south, bringing Hasdrubal's head
as a grim messenger to Hannibal
of his brother's defeat. The story
is told by Livy 27, 43 ff.—Has-
drubal devictus: the victory over,
etc. 3 cf. mos deductus v. 19
above.—pulcher: cf. n. to sol
pulcher 4, 2, 47.—-Latio: abl.
with fugatis.

41 ff. adorea: victory, appar-
ently an archaic word which Hor-
ace called back into use—dirus

. . Afer: cf. 3, 6, 36 Hanniba-
lem dirum. — ut : tem poral, since.

Cf. Epod. 7, 19. —--ceu: only here
