2, 15, 1] HORATI

Such protests are common to all times of wealth and luxury. Another
example is 3, 6. Augustus tried to restrain the growth of private extrava-
gance, and to restore the agricultural prosperity of Italy. Some editors
have wished, therefore, to connect this ode with the date (28 B.C.) at
which Octavian assumed the duties of censor, and indeed it is quite pos-
sible that it was written at the emperor's request. The verses are stiff.
and bear the marks of being made to order. The position here after
14, from which in some manuscripts it is not separated, is a natural one,

for it continues the attack on the folly of great wealth.

The ode is,

however, wholly impersonal, not even the indefinite second person being

used, and lacks the poetica] quality of 14.

Iam pauca aratro iugera regiae
moles relinquent; undique latius
extenta visentur Lucrino
stagna lacu, platanusque caelebs

5 evincet ulmos; turn violaria et
myrtus et omnis copia narium

1 ff. Cf. with the the general sen-
timent of the ode Seneca Epist. 89,
21 quousque nullus erit lacus, cui
uon villarum vestrarum fastigia
immineant, nullum flumen, cuius
nan ripas aedificia vestra prae-
texant? . . . ubicumque iu aliquem
sinum litus curvabitur vas prati-
uus fundamenta facietis, uec can-
tenti sala, uisi quod man u feceritis,
mare agetis introrsus (cf. C. 2, 183
3, 24).—regiae moles: zie. the pal-
aces of the rich. Cf. n. to 2, 14,
11, also 3, 29, 10, where Maecenas'
city house is called malem propin-
quam nubibus arduis.

3 f. visentur: will be seen with
wonder.— Lucrino . . . lacu: near
Baiae, famous for its oysters and
fish. Cf. n. to Epad. 2, 49. —stagnaz
piscinae, in which the fish dear

to Roman epicures were raised.—
platanus caelebs: during the last ν
century ΒΕ. the plane tree became
a favorite for parks and gardens.
Cf. 2, 11, 13. The thick shade
which its broad leaves cast made
it unsuited as a support for the
vine —therefore called caelebs. · Cf.
n. to Epad. 2, 10. Martial,.3, 58,
3, names it vidua platanus.

5. evincet: slzall drive out.—
violaria : violet beds‚· with the myr-
tle—a flowering shrub—and other
sweet-smelling flowers, typical of
luxury.

6 ff. omnis copia narium: all tlze
wealtll (of flowers) tlzatfills tlte nas-
trils,· an intentionally artificial ex-
pression for adar. used here to hint
at Horace’s dislike sor such elabo-
rate flower gardens. —olivetis: lo-
