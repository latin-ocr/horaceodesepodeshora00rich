tus' household by his stepmother, Octavia3 every honor was shown him
until the discovery of his liaison with the infamous Julia, when he was
put to death (2 Bc). It is said that he was the author of an epic,
Diomeden, in twelve books, and of some prose works besides.

The occasion and date of the ode are both uncertain. It was proba·
bly written in the winter of 16—15 B.C. or early in the following spring,
with the expectation that the Emperor would soon return ς many, how-
ever, prefer to place its composition in 14—13 B.C. But why should
Horace, if writing at that date, mention only Augustus' comparatively
unimportant success over the Sygambri and their allies in 16 B.C., and
have nothing to say of the brilliant Alpine campaigns of Tiberius and
Drusus in 15 Bc? The fact that these are celebrated in odes 4 and 14
will hardly account for silence here, if: the later date of composition
be accepted. The occasion which prompted the verses may have been
a request from Antonius for a Pindaric ode, which Horace turns aside
in a manner similar to that of1,6. Or we may suppose that Horace
chose this way to express his own eager anticipation of Augustus)
return and to pay Antonius a (possibly) extravagant compliment.
Whatever its date, the position of the ode gives it the effect ofa depre‘
catory preface to odes 4 and 14. Metre, 69.
