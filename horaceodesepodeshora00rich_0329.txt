CARMINA

[3‚ 29, 34

quid Seres et regnata Cyro
Bactra parent Tanaisque discors.

Prudens futuri temporis exitum
30 caliginosa nocte premit deuS,
ridetque si mortalis ultra

fas trepidat.

Quod adest memento

componere aequus: cetera fluminis
ritu feruntur, nunc medio alveo

reference is apparently to Maece-
nas' position as Augustus' chief
adviser in the settlement of the
empire, and as the Emperor's rep-
resentative during his absence in
26-2513.c.—urbi: with both sol-
licitus and times—Seres, etc.:
Horace ironically chooses remote
peoples to show how needless
Maecenas' fears are. — regnata
Cyro: cf. 2, 6, 11.-—-Bactra: the
farthest part of the Parthian Em-
pire. —Tanais : τῖε. the Scythians.
With this use of the river for the
people who dwell by it, cf. 2, 9, 21 3
2ο, 2o.—discors: and so not to
be feared by us.

29 ff. The uncertainty of to-
morrow and the folly of being
anxious for it. Cf. Theog. 1075 ff.
πρήγματος ἀπρήκτου χαλεπώτατόν
ἐστι τελευτὴν Ι γνῶναι, ὅπως μέλ-
λει τοῦτο θεὸς τελέσαι. Ι ὀρφνὴ
γὰρ τέταται. ‘Of that Which is
yet unaccomplished it is most
d'ifficult to recognize the end and
know bow God will complete it.
A mist is stretched before us.'

—prudens . . . deus: cf. 1, 3,

21. ——caliginosaz cf. ὀρφνή ‘in the
passage of Theognis just quoted,
and Iuv. 6, 556 et genus humanum
damnat calzgo futuri.

31 f. ridet: laughs in scorn3
cf. 3, 27, 67 ridens Venus. --
mortalis ultra, etc. : ‘ mortal should
have mortal's thought53' cf. 2,
16, 17. — trepidat: frets him-
self5 cf. 2, 11, 4.—quod adest,
etc.: one of Horace's favorite
rules for a wise life. So Pind.
P. 3, 21 ff. ἔστι δὲ φῦλον ἆν-
θρώποισι ματαιότατον, Ι ὅστις αἷσ-
χύνων ἐπιχώρια παπταίνει τὰ
πόρσω, Ι μεταμώνια θηρεύων ἀκράν-
τοις ἐλπίσιν. ‘There is a tribe
most foolish among men, of such
as scorn the things of horne and
gaze at that which is far off, chas-
ing vain objects with hopes that
shall never be fulfilled.'

33 ff. aequus: z'.e. ‘keep thy-
self unruffled whether the hour
bring good or ill.'-—cetera: i.e.
all the future. —rituz like5 cf. 3,
14, 1 and n. ——v feruntur: areswept
along: marking the impossibility
of directing the future. Cf. Seu.
