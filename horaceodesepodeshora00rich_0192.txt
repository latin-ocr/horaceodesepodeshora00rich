Licinius Murena, to whom the ode is addressed, was apparently the
son of the Murena whom Cicero defended3 he was adopted by M. Te-

during this year he entered into a conspiracy with Fannius Caepio
against the emperor, but was detected and put to death. This is clear
evidence that Horace’s poem was published before that date. It is
said that he was inordinately ambitious, so that the advice here given
acquires a special significance in view of his later fate. Metre, 69.
