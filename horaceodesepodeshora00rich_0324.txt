HORATI

'l‘he festival which occasioned this ode was the Neptunalia, which
fell on July 23. The people celebrated it in open air festival, erecting
booths of boughs, called umbrae, along the banks of the Tiber or on the
seasho-re, for protection from the sun. Horace, however, represents
himself as on his farm, where he bids his severe housekeeper join him

in a carouse. Metre, 71.

Festo quid potius die

Neptuni faciam? Prome reconditum,
Lyde, strenua Caecubum,
munitaeque adhibe vim sapientiae.

5 Inclinare meridiem

sentis et, veluti stet volucris dieS,
parcis deripere horreo

cessantem Bibuli consulis amphoram.
Nos cantabimus invicem

θ 1 ff. It suddenly occurs to Hor-
ace that it is the day of N eptune's
festival, which furnishes him an
excuse for some relaxation. —
prome ε, cf. 1, 36, 11.——recondi-
tum': boarded away in the back
of the apotheea3 cf. Epaa'. 9, 1
repastum Caecubum. — strenua :
to be taken with prome, hurry and
broaclz. —munitae . . . sapientiae:
your well fortzfied (and stern)
philosophy. Lyde is evidently not
given to carouses, but Horace
begs her for once to do violence
to her strenuous principles. Some
critics have wished to believe that
Lyde—who probably lived only
in Horace's imagination——was a
flute girl, yet music girls possessed
no munitam sapientiam to hinder a
carouse, ancl the whole wit of Hor-
ace's verses lies in the absurdity

of this proposal to his severe and
probably old housekeeper to join
him in a drinking bout and song.

5 f. ‘It is already late and we
must hurry.' —inclinare meridiem ε
a common belief was that the sun
and stars were fixed in the vaulted
sky, which revolved‚ carrying them
with it. Cf. Cic. Tus'c. 3, 3, 7 in-
clinata iam in postmeridianum
tempus die. — et: and yet. — stet:
were standing still.

7 f. deripere: to hurry down.
Cf. 3, 21, 7, descende and n. With
the infin.9 cf. Epist. 1, 3, 16 ut
tangere vitet. —— horreo: z'.e. the
apotheca—cessantem: as if the
jar were reluctant.—Bibuli: M. Cal-
purnius Bibulus, consul in 59 B.C.

91⁸. nos: l, astu, v. 11 shows;
cf. 1, 6, 5 and n.—invicem: in ’
my turn. - viridis: the ‘tradit'
