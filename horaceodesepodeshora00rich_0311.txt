CARMINA

[3. 24, 46

mundi nec Boreae finitimum latus
durataeque solo nives
40 mercatorem abigunt, horrida callidi
vincunt aequora navitae,
magnum pauperies opprobrium iubet
quidvis et facere et pati,
virtutisque viam deserit arduae?
45 Vel nos in Capitolium,
⁷ quo clamor vocat et turba faventium,

inclusa: senced in, intrenclzed
(against man). The same idea 1,
22, 22 terra domibus negata. ——
latus: cf. Ι, 22, 19.—so10: loca-
tive ablative. Intr. 95.

40. mercatorem: Horace's type
of the man restless and reckless
for gain. Cf. 1,1,16; 1, 3 entire3
Epist. 1, 1, 45 f. imnger e.t·tremos
curris mercator ad Indos, {per
mare pauperiem fiagiens, per saxa,
per egnes—horrida callidi: jux-
taposed to strengthen the contrast
between man’s skill and nature's
savagery.

42 f. magnum . . . opprobrium:
cf. S. 2, 3, 91 f. credidit ingens
pauperiem vitium. With the
sentiment, cf. Theogn. 649 ff. ἆ
δειλὴ πενίη, τί ἐμοῖς ἐπικειμένη
ὤμοις Ι σῶμα καταισχύνεις καὶ νόον
ἡμέτερον, Ι αἰσχρὰ δὲ μ’ οὐκ ἐθέλον-
τα βίῃ καὶ πολλὰ διδάσχεις, ‘Ah,
wretched poverty, why dost thou
weigh on my shoulders and de-
grade my body and my mind?
And though I would not, thou
dost teach me perforce much that
is shameful.' Lucian Apol. 10

πενίαν πάντα ποιεῖν καὶ πάσχειν
ἀναπείθουσαν, ὡς ἐκφύγοι τις
αὐτήν, ‘Poverty who persuades
a man to do and suffer all things
that he may escape her.'

44. ‘The path of virtue steep'
is proverbial3 cf. Hes. Op. 289 ff,
τῆς δ’ ἀρετῆς ἱδρῶτα θεοὶ προπά-
ροιθεν ἔθηκαν Ι ἀθάνατοι · μακρός
δὲ καὶ ὄρθιος οἶμος ἐπ’ αὐτήν, and
Hamlet's ‘steep and thorny way
to Heaven.'— deserit: the ab·
straet pauperies suggests a con-
crete subject pauper.

45 ff. Horace here expresses
himself with the fire of a religious
reformer. Sacrifice of jewels and
gold will prove the people's sin-
cerity. Epod. 16 is written in
the same strain. — in Capitolium :
as an offering to Jove. There is
no verb until we reach mittamus
v. 50, but the Roman reader would
hardly be conscious of the lack. —
clamor et turba : the shouting
crowd. —faventium2 Horace pic—
tures the common people applaud-
ing the rich as they march to the
Capitol to dedicate their wealth.
