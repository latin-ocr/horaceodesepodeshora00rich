mander, by which he bound him-
self to follow wherever he might

tition marks Horace's earnestness.

17 ff. ‘It matters not what stars
presided over my natal hour, our
horoscopes agree in marvelous
fashion.' This reference to as-
trology is an indulgence to Mae-
cenas' belief in the art. for Horace
had no saith in the numeri of the
Babylonians (1, 11). — Scorpios

is apt, for under this sign warriors
were born. Cf. Manil. 4, 220 f.
in bellum ardentis animos et Mar-
tia castra Ι efficit (sc. Scorpios) et
multum gaudentem sanguine
civem. Libra, however, gave a
more favorable destiny. Cf. Manil.

of the three constellations named)
witlz greater power. — tyrannus,
etc.: the various quarters of the
earth were assigned to the differ-
ent signs of the zodiac3 the sys-
tem of astrology current in the
early empire gave Capricornus
the western part of the world.
