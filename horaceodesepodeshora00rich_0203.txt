[ε. ¹3, 38

Vtrumque sacro digna silentio
30 mirantur umbrae dicere; sed magis
pugnas et exactos tyrannos

densum umeris bibit aure volgus,

Quid mirum, ubi illis carminibus stupens

35 auris et intorti capillis
Eumenidum recreantur angues?

Quin et Prometheus et Pelopis parens

Furies relaxed their rage.'——stu-
