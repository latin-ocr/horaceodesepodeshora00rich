the boundary stone without war-
rant was an act of the greatest
impiety. Cf. Paul. p. 368 Numa
Pompilius statuit eum qui termi-
num emrasset et ipsum et boves
sacros (accursed) esse‚· and Deu-
teronomy, 27, 17 ‘Cursed be he that
removeth his neighbour's land-
1nark.'—ultra limites, etc.: the sa-
cred duty of patron toward client
likewise has no weight with such a
man. The laws of the Twelve
Tables condemned the patron
who should do his client wrong,
PATRONVS SI CLIENTI FRAVDEM
FECERIT, SACER ESTO.

26 ff. salis: cf. revellis v. 24 and
ῐ, 3, 24 transiliunt. Horace may
have seen an eviction like this in
his own district. —pellitur: for
the number, see Intr. 101.—pater-
nos . . . deos: the little images of
his household gods are all that the
evicted client now possesses.--sor-
didos: ragged.

29. tamen: ‘in spite of all thy
wealth and unrestrained greed‚ no
palace is so sure for thee as Orcus'

Hic superbum

hall.'— fine . . . destinata: to be
taken together3 ablative with cer-
tior. It is the end which Orcus
fixes3 the Greek θανάτοιο τελευτή.
finis is feminine only here and
Epod. 17, 36.

’ 30. rapacis Orci: the adjective
is emphatic— the rapacity of Orcus
outdoes that of the greedy rich at
last.

31 f. divitem. . . erum: in sharp
contrast to the position which he
will presently hold. ‘Now thou
art rich and lord, but in Orcus'
home thy riches will not help thee.'
——ultra: ᾖε. ‘strive to gain more
than thou now possessest.'—ae-
qua: ιἠῑρανίίαίζν, without distinc-
tion. Cf. Ι, 4, 13 f. pallida mors
aequo pulsat pede pauperum laber-
ηας Ι regumque turris.

34 ff. pueris: equivalent tofiliis5
for the metre, cf. Intr. 56.—nec
satelles Orci, etc.: an attempt by
Prometheus to bribe Charon to
serry him back is referred to only
here. cf. n. to 2, 13. 37.—calli-
dum: predicate, for all his clever-
