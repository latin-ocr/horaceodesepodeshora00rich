SCHOLIA AND EDITIONS [ἓ 15

The work of all these commentators has been lost, save in so
far as it is incorporated in the following scholia ; —

(1) The scholia· of Pomponius porphyrio, a grammarian of the
third century apparently, who devoted himself chiefly to gram-
matical and rhetorical interpretation.

(2) The scholia which bear the name of Acro. This collection
was drawn from many sources, one of which was Porphyrio, from
whom much was taken. Acro's name was not attached to these

scholia until the fifteenth century.
(3) The scholia of the Commentator Cruquz‘anus. These are

. the comments gathered together by Cruquius from many sources,

and are of slight value.

(c) Editions.—The place and date of the editio princeps is
unknown, but it was published in Italy before 1471. Bentley's edi-
tion in 171 1 made a new era in Horatian criticism. Of the modern
critical and explanatory editions, the following are important : —

Keller and Holder‚ edilia maior, 2 vols. Leipsic, 1864—18703
vol. 1 (Odes, Epodes, and C. S.) in 2d ed. by Keller, Leipsic,

v 1899 ; editio minor, 1878. Keller, Epz‘legomena zu Herm, Leip-
· sie, 1879-1880, is also important for its collection of variant
readings and discussion of them.

Orelli, 4th ed. by Hirschfelder and Mewes, 2 vols„ with Latin
commentary and complete word index, Berlin, 1886, 1892.

Kz'esslz'ng, 2d ed., 3 vols. Berlin, 1890—18973 vol. 1 in 3d ed„
1898.

VVicklzam, Odes and Epodes, 3d ed. Oxford‚ 1896 3 Satires
and Epislles, 1891.

L. Milller, Satires and Epistles, Leipsic, 1891—1893. Odes
and Epodes, 1900.

The scholia are not yet fully available in good editions. A be-
ginning has been made by Keller and Holder‚ Porfitrz'onz‘s
commentum rec. A. Holder. Innsbruck‚ 1894. The scholia of
the Commentator Cruquianus are now best printed in Keller and
Holder’s large edition, vol. 1, 2d ed„ pp. 343—370.
