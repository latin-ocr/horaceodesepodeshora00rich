2, 11, 1] HORATI

ΙΙ

Horace will teach his friend Hirpinus his own philosophy. ‘Little
is enough for life, enjoy the present fleeting moment with no thought
of distant dangers, no greed for useless wealth. Youth quickly flies,
and old age comes. All is change. How useless then to vex our souls
with endless aims and efforts.'

Quinctius Hirpinus, apparently the friend to whom Epist. 1, 16 is
addressed, is not further known. He seems to have been ambitious for
wealth, but not averse to pleasures. The date of composition is proba-
bly fixed as 26-25 B.C. by the mention of the bellicosus Cantaber v. 1.
Metre, 68. .

1 ff. Cantaber: cf. n. to 2,>6,

position of nornen and cogno-
men, see n. to 2, 2, 3.—Hadria
divisus obiecto: as·a matter of
fact, not simply the Adriatic, but
long tracts of land and sea sepa-
rated the Scythians from Italy3
but Quinctius was too anxious
over these distant dangers, and
Horace playfully exaggerates —

, ‘set off from us only by,' etc.

The danger of a barbarian inva-
sion from the northeast was not
sufficiently present to the Roman
mind at this time to cause Horace
to speak seriously of the barrier
the Adriatic would afford. In
later centuries, however, this sea
often protected Italy. —remittas

There is probably also the acces·
sory idea of relaxing the anxious
strain. We may translate, give up
thy anxious questioning. Cf. Ter.
And. 827 remittas iam me onerare
iniurizk. — trepides in usum: and
do not fret about the needs, etc.
