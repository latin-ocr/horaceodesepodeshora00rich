HORATI

centurn iuvenciS, sive mendaci lyra

40 voleS, sonare ‘ Tu pudica, tu proba
perambulabis astra sidus aureum.' .
Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vicem
fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece
adempta vati reddidere lumina:

45 et tu (potes nam) solve me dementia,
o nec paternis obsoleta sordibus
nec in sepulcris pauperum prudens anus
novendialis dissipare pulveres!
Tibi hospitale pectus et purae manUS,

39.. mendaci: a telling thrust.
This word like sacris v. 6, has a
double meaning. His lyre may
be mendax in what it has already
said or in what it will proclaim.

40 f. sonare: sound abroad.
Cf. C. 2, 13. 26.—tu pudica, tu
proba: so Catullus 'in mockery
42, 24 pudica et proba, redde
codicillos. —perambulabis: for her
virtues Canidia shall be raised to
heaven and wander among the
other stars.

42—44. Helen's brothers, Cas-
tor and Pollux, punished her de-
famer Stesichorus with blindness
(cf. C. 4, 9. 8) ; his recantation is
preserved by Plato, Phaedr. 243 A.
οὐκ ἔστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος Ι οὐδ’
ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν ἐυσέλμοις, οὐδ’ ἵκεο
Πέργαμα Τροίας.

—vicemz lot. —vatit a bord.
Cf. n. to 16. 66. ,

45. et tu: ‘you too have divine
power) For the complimentary
potes nam. cf. S. 2, 3, 283 f.‚ a unum

me surpite morti! dis etenim fa-
cz'le est' orabat.

46—52. At the very climax οῖ’
the appeal Horace repeats the
worst slanders current against
Canidia—0 nec paternis, etc.:
‘unsullied by disgraceful parents,'
implying that Canidia's parentage
was dubious. With the phrase, cf.
C. 2, 10, 6 obseletz’ sordes tecit} and
Cic. pro Sest. 60 (virtus) neque
alienis unquam sordibus obsolescit.

47 f. prudens anus ε nor art thou
a hag skilled to scaller7 etc. The
ashes of the poor whose relatives
could not protect their tombs were
stolen by such witches for their
magic rites, — novendialis : τῖε. just
put away. According to Apul.
Met. 9, 31 the funeral rites were
not ended until the ninth day
(nono die completis apud tumulum
sollemnibus). They closed appar-
ently with a sacrifice and banquet
in honor of the dead. —pulveres.·
plural. to match sepulcris.
