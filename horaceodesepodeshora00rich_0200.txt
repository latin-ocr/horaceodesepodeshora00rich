HORATI

13

Horace was nearly killed one day on his farm by a falling tree.. The
following ode was suggested by this event, which seems to have made
a deep impression on him. (Cf. 2, 17, 273 3, 4, 27.) Still here his
very extravagance of earnestness gives the treatment a half jesting tone.

2, 13, 1]

After declaring that the man who planted the fatal tree could be guilty
of any crime, Horace wanders into reflection on his favorite theme—
the uncertainty of human life and the proximity of death. On the first
anniversary of the event, he wrote 3, 8, which fixes the date of his nar-
row escape as March 1, 30 B.C. This ode then was probably written
within that month. Metre, 68.

Ille et nefasto te posuit die,
quicumque primum, et sacrilega manu
produxit, arbos, in nepotum

perniciem opprobriumque pagi3
