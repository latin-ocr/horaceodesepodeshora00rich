¹00 et Esquilinae alites; ἡ

effugerit spectaculum.’

wolves and birds to prey on.—
post: adverb. -— Esquilinae Η ali-
tes: for the hiatus, see Intr. 43.
101 f. neque hoc . . . effugerit:
‘my parents will notfail to see
your mangled corpses and gloat
over them.' — heu mihi superstites:
The boy turns from his own fate
to pity for his parents. His death
will deprive them of the joy and
support which their old age should
have known. The saduess of
such bereavement oppressed the
ancients‚ whose religious ideas
gave no consolation for early death.

Horace here breaks off, observing
the rules he laid down himself sor
the drama, Epist. 2, 3, 182 ff.
non tamen intus l dtgna geri promes
in scaenam, multaque tolles Ι ex
oculis, quae mox narret facundia
praeserzS‚ Ι ne pueros coram po-
pulo Medea trucidet, Ι aut hu-
mana palam coquat exta nefarius
Atreus, Ι aut in avem Procne verla-
lur, Cadmus in anguem. He thus
leaves us impressed with the
pathos of the situation, not the

manner of the boy's horrible
death.

An attack on a scurrilous defamem who like a cowardly cur dared to
assail only those who could not fight in return. ‘Attack me‚' says
Horace, ‘and you will find I am ready to bite back. You bark nobly
and then sniff the bone thrown to you (1-10). I shall prove a bull
with horns as sharp as the iambi of Archilochus or Hipponax3 1 am no
boy to cry and not strike back (11-16).' The metaphors are only
apparently mixed, for at v. 11 Horace definitely abandons the figure of
the dog.

Who the object of this attack was must remain uncertain. A num-
ber of MSS. have the inscription in Cassium Severum, by which
the early commentators probably meant the orator Cassius Severus,
banished by Augustus on account of his defamatory writings (Tac.
Dial. 19: Anu. Ι, 27; 4, 21). But this Cassius belonged to Ovid's
generation. so that he can hardly be the person meant.
guesses are equally futile.
