HORATI

6

Addressed to the poet's devoted friend Septimius, probably the same
whom he commends to Tiberius, Epist. 1, 93 he is also named in a
letter by Augustus to Horace, of which a fragment has been preserved
by Suetonius in his life of Horace (p. 297 R.). A melancholy strain
runs through the ode ε the poet is filled with thoughts of his old age and
prays that Tivoli. or if that spot be refused, beautiful Tarentum, may be
the home of his last years. There Septimius shall shed a tear over the
ashes of his friend.

The exact date of composition cannot be determined, but it has been
conjectured with good reason that the ode was written during an illness,
or when Horace was oppressed with fears of early death3 it was cer-
tainly at a time when he felt his position established so that he could
speak of himself as ‘vates,’ ie. it was after the publication of the epodes.
Possibly the reference in v. 2 may fix the date as between 27 and 25
ss.C. See n. below. Metre, 69.

a. 6. ι]

Septimi, Gadis aditure mecum et

Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre nostra et

barbaras Syrtis, ubi Maura semper
aestuat unda:

ς Tibur Argeo positum colono
sit meae sedes utinam senectae,

1. Gadis: the modern Cadiz;
‘to the limits of the world) Cf.
2, 2, 11 remotis Gadibus. —
aditure: wlzo woula'st ga. Intr.

Augustus conducted campaigns
against them in person in 27-25
B.C., but they were not finally
subjugated until 19 Bc. Cf. 3,

110. So Catullus says ironically
11, 1 f. F uri et Aureli, comites
Catulli, Ι sive in extremos-penetra-
&t Indos, etc.

2. iuga ferre: dependent on
indoctum. This figure taken from
the breaking of cattle is a poeti-
cal commonplace. The Cantabri
were a fierce people in northwest-
ern Spain who successfully re-
sisted the Romans for many years.

8, 22 Cantaber sera domitus ca-

tena, and 4, 14, 41 Cantaber nan
ante dailiabi'lis.

3. barbaras Syrtis: so called
alike from their situation and cruel
nature. Cf. 1, 22, 5 per Syrtis
. . . aestuosas and Verg. A. 4, 41
inhospita Syrtis.

5. Tibur: for Horace's affec-
tion sor Tivoli, cf. 1, 7, 1-21.—-
Argeo positum, etc. : tle. Tiburtus,
