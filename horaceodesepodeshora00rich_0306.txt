HORA'H

Immunis aram si tetigit manus,
non sumptuosa blandior hostia,
mollivit aversos Penatis

other special festivals honor was
paid to the Lares. So Cato de Agr.
143 directs (vilica) kalendis idibus
nonis, festus dies cum erit, coro-
nam infoeum indat, per eosdemque
dies Lari familiari pro copia snp-
plicet. — marino rore : the aromatic
rosemary used by those who could
not afford the costly imported in-
cense. — fragili: brz'ttle.

17 f. immunis: here innocent,
guiltless5 elsewhere in Horace it
means ‘without bringing a gif&
4, 12, 233 Epist. 1, 14. 33. In
this passage, however, the point
which Horace wishes to empha-
size is the acceptability of inno-
cence over great offerings‚ so that
immunis is used absolutely in the
sense of immunis sceleris. The
idea is commonplace. Cf. Eurip.
Frg. 327 ἐγὼ δὲ πολλάκις σοφωτέ-
ρους 1 πένητας ἄνδρας εἰσορῶ τῶν
πλουσίων, l καὶ <τοὺς> θεοῖσι μικρὰ
θύοντας τέλη Ι τῶν βουθυτούντων
ὄντας εὐσεβεστέρους. ⁴1 ofttimes
see poor men are wiser than
the rich, and they who make small
offerIngs to the gods more pious

than men who sacrifice great vio
tims ;' also Frg. 946 εὖ ἴσθ’, ὅταν
τις εὐσεβῶν θύῃ θεοῖς, Ι κᾶν μικρὰ
θύῃ, τυγχάνει σωτηρίας. ⁴ Be sure
that when a pious man makes
offering to the gods, even though
his offering be small, he gains
their saving aid.'

-non sumptuosa, etc. : the
verse somewhat awkwardly adds a
new idea to the preceding state-
ment— (thy hand) not made tlte
more persnasz've by any costly via
tim.

19 f. mollivit: the gnomic per-
fect in conclusion—il lzas (and
always will), eto—aversos: not
⁶ hostiles but disinclz‘ned, indi er-
em‘; cf. Epod. 10, 18. —Penatisz
not distinguished frorn the Lares.
——farre pio, etc.: a circumlocu-
tion for the mola salsa, the sacri-
ficial cake, made of spelt and salt.
The phrase is used by Tibullus 3,
4, 10 farre pio placant et saliente
sale: also by Ovid Fast. 4, 409 f.
farra deae micaeque licet salientis
honorem detis. —- saliente: tle.
when the salt was thrown on the fire.
