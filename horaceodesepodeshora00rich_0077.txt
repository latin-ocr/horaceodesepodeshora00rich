‘ Varius, who vies with Homer, shall sing thy exploits‚ Agrippa.
The deeds of heroes and tragic themes are all too great for my weak
powers; Iwill not detract from Caesar’s fame and thine. Only wine
ancl lovers' quarrels are suited to my verse.'

Addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, Augustus' ‘Minister of War'
and greatest general 3 he defeated Sextus Pompey at Naulochus, 36 ss.c.‚
and was commander at Actium, 31 ΒΕ. Apparently Agrippa, or
Agrippa⁷s friends, had suggested to Horace that he celebrate the gen-
eral's exploits in verse. This ode is Horace's skillful apology and should
be compared with similar expressions, 2, 12: 4. 2. 27 ff.; S. 2, 1, 123
Epist. 2, 1, 250 ff. In each case, however, while declaring his unfitness
for the task, he describes deeds of war, yet briefly, not in an elabo—
rate poem. Here by his manner of declining. he pays Agrippa the
highest tribute as well as compliments his friend Varius. The date
of composition is after 29 B.C.‚ when Agrippa returned from the East.
