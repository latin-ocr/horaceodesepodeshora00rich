HORATI

Destrictus ensis cui super impia¹
cervice pendet, non Siculae dapes
dulcem elaborabunt saporem,

κο non avium citharaeque cantus

somnum reducent; somnus agrestium
lenis virorum non humilis domos
fastidit umbrosamque ripam,
non zephyris agitata tempe.

tumultuosum sollicitat mare ⁷

17 f. destrictus ensis, etc.: the
reference is to the familiar story of
the sword ofDamocles, told by Cic.
Tnsc. 5, 61. It here typifies the
uneasy conscience and ever-pres-
ent fear of death that threaten the
wicked3 hence impia cervice. —cuiz
equivalent to ei cml—Siculae: the
Sicilians were proverbially luxu-
rious, and the adjective is especially
appropriate in connection with the
reference to Damocles. Note that
dapes is by its position contrasted
with impia—⁴ No rich banquets
can offset the tyrant's wickedness.'

19 f. elaborabunt: produce, when
his natural appetite is gone. For
the prepositional prefiX, cf. n. to 1,
5, 8.—-avium: aviaries were com-
mon in houses of the rich in Hor-
ace's day. — citharaeque cantus : we
are told by Seneca, De Prov. 3. 10
that Maecenas, who suffered from
insomnia, tried to allure sleep by
soft and distant music, but natu-

21 f. reducent: bringback‚ when
it has fied—somnus: note the esu
fect of the repetition—agrestium
. . .virorum: belonging grammati-
cally to somnus lenis, but felt also
with domos. The simple sarmers
with their lowly homes, the mur-
mur of the breezes in pleasant val-
leys, are here contrasted with the
rich man's palace‚ its aviaries and
instrumental music. The sleep of
the poor is proverbially sweet. Cf.
Epist. Ι, 7, 35 somnum plebis laudo.
Also‚ Ecclesiastes 5, 12 ·The sleep
ofa labouring man is sweet. . .; but
the abundance of the rich will not
suffer him to sleep.'

23 f. Cf. Epod. 2, 25-28 labun-
tur altis interim rzpzs aquae,l que-
rantur in silvis aves, Ι frondesque
lymphis obstrepunt manantibus Ι
somnos quod invitet levis. —tempe ε
used here for any shady valley. Cf.
n. to 1, 7, 4.

25ff. desiderantem, etc.: ‘the

to his patron.
