8, ι 5] HORATI

¹5 Quid quod libelli Stoici inter sericos
iacere pulvillos amant ?
Inlitterati num minus nervi rigent?
minusve languet fascinum,
quod ut superbo provoces ab inguine,
20 ore adlaborandum est tibi?

Addressed to Maecenas in September, 31 B.c., on hearing of Octan
vian's success at Actium. In eager enthusiasm Horace asks his patron
when they can hope to celebrate together this glorious victory, as they
had celebrated a few years before the defeat of Sextus Pompey. The
evidence seems to show that Maecenas was in Rome at the time this was
written (see introduction to Epod. Ι), but those who believe that Mae-
cenas was present at Actium regard the opening lines as additional
evidence that he took part in the battle. Some even hold that the
graphic details mentioned prove that Horace also was there.

After the address to Maecenas (1-10), Horace reflects on the dis-
grace Antony has brought on the Romans by enslaving himself to an
oriental queen (ιι-16), a sight that made the Gauls desert to Caesar,
and the queen's own fleet withdraw (17—20). ‘Hail, Triumph‚ dost
thou delay the great procession for the mightiest leader thou 'nast ever
yet brought home (21-26). The enemy has changed his purple robe
for mourning and flees to farthest lands (27—32). Corne, boy, bring
larger cups and stronger wine, I will forget my care and fear for Caesar
(33-38).' With this epode compare C. 1, 37 written a year later injoy
at the news of Cleopatra's death. Metre, 74.
