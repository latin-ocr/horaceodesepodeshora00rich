1, 9, 1] ’ HORATI

The ode clearly suggested to Tennyson the lines, ln Memm. 107
‘Fiercely flies Ι The blast of North and East. and 1ce Ι Makes daggers
at the sharpend eaves‚ . . ‚But fetch the wine, Ι Arrange the board
and brim the glass, ΙΙ Bring in great logs and let them lie, Ι To make
a solid core of heat3'1Be cheerful-minded, talk and treat Ι Of all
things ev'n as he were by.7

Thaliarchus (v. 8) is only a person of Horace's fancy, although
the name was in actual use, as is shown by inscriptions. The ode is
evidently a study and not an occasional poem3 while it probably be-
longs to Horace's earlier attempts at lyric verse, the skill with which it
is written has won admiration from all critics. Metre‚ 68.
