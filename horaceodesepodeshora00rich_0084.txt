HORATI

cum fugeret, tamen uda Lyaeo
tempora populea fertur vinxisse corona,
sic tristis adfatus amicos:
ις '⁶ ‘Quo nos cumque feret melior fortuna parente,
ibimuS‚ o socii comitesque!
Nil desperandum Teucro duce et auspice Teucr0;
certus enim promisit Apollo

(17-20) by a mythological illustra-
tion is afavorite device of Horace.
This particular story is found only
here: Teucer's father, Telamon,
refused to receive him on his re-
turn from Troy, since he had failed
to bring his brother, AjaX, with
hi1n3 therefore Teucer sought a
new home in Cyprus, where he
’ founded a city, named after his
birthplace. The tale was a fa-
miliar one from Pacuvius’ tragedy,
Teucer, which was much admired.
Cf. Frg. 12 R. (which is a part of
Telamon's reproach) segregare abs
te ausu's aut sine illo Salaminam
ingredi, Ι ne'que paternum aspec-
tum es veritus, quom ae'tate exacta
indigem 1 liberum lacerasti orbastz'
effluxu, neque fratris necis Ι ne'que
eius gnati parvi, qui tibi in tutelam
est traditus? Cic. T usc. 5, 108 re-
fers to the story, itaque ad onmem
rationem Teucri vox accommodari
potest: ‘Patria est, ubicumque est
bene.'

ing to exile. —tamenz ⁴ in spite of

Liber, Λύσιος. —— populea: sacred

to Hercules. Cf. Verg. A. 8, 276 dence. ——certus:

ἔχων λεύκαν, εΗρακλεός ἱερὸν ἔρνος.
The appropriateness of Teucer’s
honoring Hercules at this time
lies in the character of Hercules
as a traveler (3, 3, 9 vagus Her-
cules) and leader (Xen. Anah..
4, 8, 25 ἡγεμών), to whose pro—
tection Teucer might naturally in-
trust himself when starting on this
uncertain journey. Furthermore
it was in company with Hercules
that Telamon took Troy (cf.
Verg. A. 1, 619 ff.) and captured
Hesione, who became Teucer's
mother.

25. quo . . . cumque: cf. n. to 1,
6, 3.—me1ior parente: kinder than
my father. Cf. Telamon's reproach
quoted on v. 21 above.

27. Teucro . . . Teucro: note that
the substitution of the proper name
for me . . . me appeals to their
loyalty.—duce et auspice: formed
from the technical Roman phrase,
cf. Suet. Aug. 21 domuit autem,
partim ductu, partim auspiciis
suis Cantabriam.
