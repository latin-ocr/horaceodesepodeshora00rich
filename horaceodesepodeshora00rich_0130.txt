HORATI

Ergo Quintilium perpetuus sopor

urget 1

Cui Pudor et Iustitiae soror,

inc orrupta Fides, nudaque Veritas
quando ullum inveniet parem?

Multis 1116 bonis flebilis occidit,
⁴0 nulli flebilior quam tibi, Verg ili;
tu frustra pius heu non itazcreditum
poscis Quintilium deos.

Quid si Threicio blandius Orpheo
· auditam moderere arboribus fide-m Ρ.

5f. ergo: emphatically intro-
ducing the θρῆνος, and expressing
a reluctant conclusion, so then.
Cf. Ovid‚ Trisl. 3, 2, 1 ergo erat in
fillis Scythiam quoque visere nos-
lma—perpetuus: Imbrokem for-
ever. -— urget: hold down. Cf.
premet 1, 4, 16, and Verg. A. 10,
745* f. olli dura quies oculos et
ferreus urget Ι somn us‚· in aeler-
nam clauduntur lumina noctem.
-cui: emphatic, ‘when shall we
see his like again.' — Iustitiae soror

. . Fides: the personified virtues
are those possessed by Quintiliu53
they are the basis of every high
character and of all justice. Cf. Cic.
de Off. 1, 23 fundamentum autem
est iustitiae fida, id est dictarum
conventorumque constantia et veri-
tas. .

7. nuda Veritas: cf. the unper—
sonified English ⁶ naked truth.'¹

9 f. multis . . . nulli: depend-
ing on flebilis . . . flebilior. Ad-
Jectives in -bz'lz's and -ilz‘s are not
infrequently used as equivalent to

perfect pass. partic.; so flebilis is
equivalent to defletus, as 1, 12,
36 nobilis to natus. Cf. Engr.
(ᾖ. 215 Kaibel ἤλυθες εἷς Ἀίδην
ζητούμενος οἷς ἀπέλειπες· Ιπᾶσι
γὰρ ἀλγηδὼν ἐσθλὸς ἀποιχόμενος-
Thou hast gone to Hades, missed
by all thou C’hast left behind3 for
thyas ‹roing is a goodlyg ories to all.

11 f. frustra: with both pius
and posciS. Intr.100.—pius: 2'.e.
in love for his friend—non ita .
creditum: Vergil had commended
his friend to 1116 care of the gods,
but not on the condition (ita) that
they should bring him 10 death.

13 f. quid si: making the
transition to the sole consolation
Horace can offer at the end, ‘All
thy piety and prayers are vain3
patience only can be thy consola-
tion.'—blandius Orpheo: cf. the
passages quoted on 1, 12, 8. Εν611
Orpheus could not recall his be-
loved Eurydice from the lower
world. For the story, read Vergil
