HORATI

30 clarus post ‚genitiS‚ -quatenus, heu nefas!
virtutem incolumem odimus,
sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.
Quid tristes querimoniae,
si non supplicio culpa reciditur,
35 quid leges sine moribus
vanae proficiunt, si neque fervidis
pars inclusa caloribus

30 ff. post genitis: found only
here. — quatenus: since, introduc-
ing an explanation of the preced-
ing words. The sentiment is a
commonplace. Cf. Menander (?)
δεινοὶ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ πάντες ἐσμὲν εὖ·
κλεεῖ 1 ζῶντι φθονῆσαι, κατθανόντα
δ’ αἰνέσαι, ‘For we all are quick
to envy the man of good repute
while he is alive, but when he is
dead to praise him) Horace him-
self has developed the thought
Epist. 2, 1. 10 ff„ 26 ff. Modern
poets too have many echoes of the
strain. Herrick declares with
mock resignation, ‘I make no
haste to have my numbers read : ξ
Seldome comes Glorie till a man
be dead! Pope's line also is fa-
miliar, ‘These suns of glory please
not till they set.'

—incolumemz in the living. —-
quaerimus: ποθοῦμεν. long. for,
miss. As soon as one generation
is dead, its virtues are extolled by
the surviving to disparage the
generation that succeeds.

33 f. quid, etc.: τῖε. ‘to bring
about a genuine reform we must
cut at the root of the civic corrup-

tion3 mere dismal (tristes) corn-
plainings are of no avail without
bold action.'—reciditur: a meta—
phor taken from pruning; cf. S. Ι, 3,
122 et magnis parva mineris (de-
licta) Ι falce recisurum similite.

35 f. The inefficiency of laws
unless supported by public senti-
ment and cha1acter (mores) is rec—
ognised by Aristotle [stol 2 5, 14
ὃ . . . νόμος ἰσχὺν οὗδεμίαν” εχει
προς ΤΟ πείθεσθαί παρα ΤΟ ἔθος,
and present day conditions sup-
ply many examples. Some years
later Horace extolled Augustus'
reign with the words mos et lex
maculosum edomuit nefas (4, 5,
22) 3 Tacitus glorifies his Germans
plns ibi bom· mores valent quam
alibi bonae leges (Germ. 19).

36 ff. si neque, etc.: the spe-
cial cases to illustrate the general
truth contained in the preceding
question: ‘if the greed for gain
has grown so great that men dare
everything save the crowning dis-
grace of poverty‚ what can mere
statutes do ?' Cf. Petron. 14
qm'dfaciant lega, ubi sola pecunia

regnam—pars: cf. 3, 3, 55.-·
