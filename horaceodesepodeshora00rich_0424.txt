HORATI

exsecta uti medulla et aridum iecur
amoris esset poculum,
interminato cum semel fixae cibo
⁴0 intabuissent pupulae.
Non defuisse masculae libidinis
Ariminensem Foliam
et otiosa credidit Neapolis
et omne evicinum oppidum,
⁴5 quae sidera excantata voce Thessala
lunamque caelo deripit.
Hic inresectum saeva dente livido
Canidia rodens pollicem

38 ff. amoris poculum: cf. 17,
80 desiderique temperare pocula.
—- interminato: forbidden, in pas-
sive sense.—semel: connect with
intabuissent.——cibo: dative with
fixae and intabuissent alike. Intr.

41—46. Horace skillfully says that
he has only heard from Neapolitan
gossip that Folia was present, thus
implying that his statements in re-
gard to the other three are based
on certain knowledge. — masculae
libidinis ε descriptive genitive with
Foliam.

43. otiosa . . . Neapolis ε cf.
Ovid. Met. 15, 711 in otia natam
Parthenopen. This Greek city
was given to gossip: according to
‘the ancient commentator it was
calledfabulosa. Gossip and curi-
osity are characteristic of the Greek
people. Cf. Demost. thlzp. 1, 10
(to the Athenians) ἦ βούλεσθε,

εἶπέ μοι, περιιόντες αὑτῶν πυνθά-

νεσθαι ‘⁴ λέγεταί τι καινόν,·” and
Acts 17, 21. Livy represents the
Roman point of view when he says
of the Neapolitans, 8, 22 gens lin-
gua magis strenua quam factis.

44. omne vicinum oppidum: es-
pecially the luxurious watering-
place Baiae, whose characteristics
in the following century are so well
depicted in Petronius' Cena Tri-
malchionis.

45 f. The power regularly as-
signed to incantations. Cf. Verg.
E 8, 69 carmina vel caelo possunt
deducere lunam.

47 f. hic ε tlzen, marking a point
in the preparations. — inresectum:
‹zoitlz untrinmzed nail. Long nails
are marks of witches; with them
they tear their victims, since the
use of iron is impossible in magic.
Canidia gnaws her nail in frenzied
impatience. Cf. Mart. 4, 27, 5
ecce iterum nigros conrodit lividus
ungues. — livido: her very teeth
