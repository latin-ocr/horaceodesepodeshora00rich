quicquid de Libycis verritur areis.

Gaudentem patrios findere sarculo
agros Attalicis condicionibus
numquam demoveaS‚ ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare;

Epist. Ι, 19, 37 ventosa plebs.—
tergeminis: the three necessary
steps in the republican cursus
honorum, the curule aedileship,
praetorship‚ and consulship.

91'. proprio: with quicquid, re-
ferring to the avarice which is
frequently connected with great
wealth. For the expression, cf.
3, 16, 26 f. si quicquid arat im-
nger Apulus Ι occultare meis di-
cerer horreis.— Libycis: Africa,
especially the fertile district of
Byzacium about Utica and Ha—
drumetum, was at this time the
granary of Rome3 later, Egypt
became the most important source
of supply.

11 ff. A modest establishment‚
in contrast to a great estate in
Africa—patrios: in this word there
is a suggestion of contentment and
calm security, as in Epod. 2, 3 pa-
terna rura. This security is again
contrasted with the vicissitudes
and perils of the sallon—sarculo:
a hoe used for stirring and loosen-
ing the soil. It suggests the small
farm that Horace has in mind, too
small to make it worth while to
use a plow.——Attalicis condicion-
ibus: wz‘tlz tlte terms α prime could

offer,- rqu'is opibus, says Porphy-
rio. The Attali. kings of Perga-
mon, were famous for their wealth.
In 133 B.C. King Attalus ΙΙΙ, at his
death, bequeathed his kingdom,
with his treasures, to the Romans.
This lent to his name the glamour
of wealth which we associate with
the name of Croesus.

13. demoveas: potential subj.,
—you could never allure. — trabe:
burk. The part is used for the
whole. Cf. Verg. A. 3, 191 vela
damus vastumque cava trabe cur-
rimns aequor ; Catull. 4, 3 natantis
impetum trabis. — Cypria: Hor-
ace regularly employs a particular
rather than a general adjective.
thereby making his expressions
more concrete and his pictures
more vivid—a device learned from
the Alexandrine poets. So we have
in the following verse Myrtoum,
15 Icariis, 19 Massici, 28 Marsus3
and often.

14. pavidus: especially applica-
ble to the landsman turned sailor.
—secet mare: a common figure
from Homer's day. Cf. Od. 3.
173ff. αὐτὰρ ὅ γ’ ἡμῖν Ι δεῖξε, καὶ
ἠνώγει πέλαγος μέσον εἷς Εὔβοιαν
ΤΕμνΕιν.
