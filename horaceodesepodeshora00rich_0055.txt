HORATI CARMINA

LIBER PRIMVS

Ι

This ode forms the prologue to the three books of lyrics publisheu
by Horace in 23 Bc. After the first two lines addressed to Maecenas,
which virtually dedicate the whole collection to him, Horace rehearses
the various interests of men, that at the end he may present his own
ambition. ‘Some men seek fame in athletic games Or in politics (3-8)‚
others have lower aims —riches‚ ease, war, or hunting (9—28) ς but as
for me, Ι have the loftiest aim of all, Maecenas— to wear the ivy wreath
and be the Muse's clear companion (29—34).' The ode was clearly
written after the collection was fairly complete3 that is, not long before
the actual publication. Men-e, 53.

—atavisz ancestors, in a general
sense, in apposition with regibus.
——edite regibus: Maecenas was
descended from an ancient line
of princes of the Etruscan city of
Arretium. Horace and his con-
temporaries emphasize the con-
trast between their patron's noble
birth and the equestrian rank he
preferred to keep at Rome. Cf.
