join the expedition of the Seven
against Thebes, for he foresaw it
would end in disaster and eost
him his own life, Polynices bribed

wards, like Orestes, was haunted
by the Furies.

14 f. vir Macedo: Philip, father
of Alexander the Great. It was
said (Plut. Aemil. Paul. 12) that

Φιλίππου χρυσίον. The Delphic
oracle has advised him to ‘fight

moda asellus onustus auro posset
ascendera—aemums reges: the
