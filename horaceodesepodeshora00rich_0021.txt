1 HORACE AND MAECENAS [55

as his representative with almost complete power, and with the
exception of a temporary estrangement in 23 B.c.‚ when he indis-
creetly betrayed to his wife Terentia the discovery of the plot
which her brother, Licinius Murena, was forming against Angustus,
he remained the emperor's most trusted advises. Naturally‚ when
Angustus’ position was firmly established, Maecenas was to a cer-
tain extent displaced by the members of the imperial family; but
the friendship between him and Augustus continued to the end.
With all his opportunity and power, Maecenas declined politi-
cal preferment, and remained a ‘ knight ' throughout his life. He
had a native taste for literature, was a master of the Greek lan·
guage, and wrote some mediocre verses himself 3 but it was by his
wise patronage of men of letters that he won a permanent place
in the grateful memory of men. He had no doubt a political pur-
pose in his patronage also, for he saw that literature might be
used to support and establish the new regime. Yet he iinposed
no fettering conditions on those to whom he gave his favor: we
know (Epod. 14) that he urged Horace to publish his Epodes3
that Vergil wrote the Georgics at his suggestion; that he advised
Propertius to undertake some larger themes3 but nowhere is
there any hint that he ever exacted any return for his favor which
would not have been spontaneously made. Of the circle he gath-
ered about him, Vergil, Horace, and Propertius achieved most
permanent fame. Others were L. Vari-us Rufus, Plotius Tucca,
Qg{r„1,ti„l,i}1§-.YQ‡³S‚ Domitius Marsus, and C4M'elissus. Maecenas’
favor assured Horace the· friendship of these and many others be-
sides that of Octavian, so that after 37 B.C. he had entrance into
the best society of his time. His friendship with Maecenas was
commingled with gratitude to him for the material aid he had
given ; but the relation between the two men had so genuine a
basis that Horace could accept Maecenas' gifts without hesitancy,
aware that his friendship was a full return in Maecenas’ mind.
His acceptance, too, involved no loss of independence, and in

many passages he makes it clear that he would readily resign an
