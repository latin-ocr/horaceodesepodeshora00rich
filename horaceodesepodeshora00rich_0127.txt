« arida nutrix.

[1, 22, 24

nec Iubae tellus generat, leonum

Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis
arbor aestiva recreatur aura,
quod latus mundi nebulae malusque

20 Iuppiter urget ;

pone sub curru nimium propinqm
solis, in terra domibus negata:
dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,

dulce loquentem.

Cf. 3, 30‚ 1-1 f. et qua pauper aquae Ι
Daunus agrestium regnavit papn-
lorum. Vergil introduced him into
the Aeneid (12, 934) as the father
of Turnus3 another legend made
him the father-in-law of Diomedes,
who assisted him against the Mes-
sapians.

15. Iubae tellus: Mauretania.
The reference is probably to the
younger Iuba, son of the king Iuba
who killed himself after the defeat
at Thapsus in 46 Bc. The young
prince received a Roman education
and was established on the throne
This
barren country (leonum arida nu-
trix) was a poor return for the
kingdom his father lost to the
Romans.

16. arida nutrix: a weak oxy-
moron. Intr. 26 a. Cf. Anon. Ante.
Pal. 6, 51 μῆτερ ἐμή, γαίη Φρυγίων,
θρέπτειρα λεόντων.

17—22. The same extremes as 3,

of Mauretania in 25 Bc.

3, 54 ff. visere gestiens Ι qua parte
debacchentur Ignes, Ι qna nebulae
pluviique rores. — pigris : dull, bar-
ren. Cf. Lucret. 5, 746 brunus
nives affert plgrmnque regerem,
and Ovid, Am. 3, 6, 94 pegra
hiems.

⁷ 19. quod latus: a parallel con-
struction to quale portentum, v. 13.
—latusz inasmuch as Horace here
thinks of the world as flat. Cf. 3,
24, 38 Boreae finitimum latus.—
malus: a sullen.

22. domibus negata: in contrast
is Vergil's description of the tem·
perate zones, G. Ι, 237 f. mor-
talibus aegris Ι munere concessae
divom.

23 f. Note the liquid sound
of these verses—dulce ridentem

. dulce loquentem: like Sap-
pho's ἇδυ φωνείσας . . . ’γελαί-
σας ἱμερόεν. Horace's second
phrase reproduces the girl's name,
Λαλαγή.
