— recens: zle. newly recruited

for the expedition of Aelius
Gallus.——timendum: part of the
prayer.

32 f. Cf. Verg. A. 8, 686 vic-
tor ab Aurorae papulis et litare
rubra. —cicatricum et sceleris . .
fratrumque: note the cumulative
force—‘the scars of civil strife
are our shame‚ a crime} a crime
against our brothers.' Cf. similar
cumulatioris 1, 5, 113 3, 5, 10.

34 ff. quid nos dura, eto: re-
producing the spirit of the first part
of Epoa'. 16.

38 ff. Ο utinam, etc. : undoubt-
edly Horace expresses in this form
his own deepest feeling. which
was shared by his more earnest
and wiser contemporaries. The

disastrous effects of thirty years of
civil war were everywhere appar-
ent, and the new order introduced
by Augustus was the only promise
of a security that would 'enable'
the state to recover its prosperity.
Deeper than all this were the hor—
rors of the struggle just ended in
which members of the same family
had been set in armed opposition
to each other. (Cf. the story of
the two brothers in Livy Per. 79.)
These did not fail to move even
the insensitive Romans.

39 f. retunsum: zze. in civil
strife. —in Massagetas: depen—
dent on diffingas, forge anew
agaznst. The Massagetae were an
Oriental people east of the Cas-
pian Sea.

Nu·

mida here appears as the warm friend and contemporary of Aelius Lamia 3
therefore considerably younger than Horace (cf. introductory n. to 1, 26).
