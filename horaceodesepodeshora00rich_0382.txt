doctae psallere Chiae
pulchris excubat in genis; Ι

importunus enim transvolat aridas
ιο quercus et refugit te quia luridi
’ denteS, te quia rugae
turpant et capitis nives;

nec Coae referunt iam tibi purpurae
nec cari lapides tempora quae semel

¹5 ⁵ notis condita fastis

inclusit volucris dies.

Quo fugit venuS, heu, quove color, decens
quo motus? Quid habes illius, illius,
quae spirabat amoreS‚
20 quae me surpuerat mihi,

οὗ δ’ ἂν εὖανθές τε καὶ εὐῶδες ᾗ,
ἐνταῦθα καὶ ἐνιζάνει καὶ μένει.
‘Love is not wont to rest upon
a form from which the flower
of beauty has already fled3 but
where fair bloom and fragrance
sweet exist, there he lights and
ever stays.'—Chiae: this name
is found on inscriptions of freed-
women. — excubat: keeps vzgz'l
cm.

9 ff. importunus: rude, ruth-
less.—aridas: in contrast with
virentis v. 6. Cf. also n. on sucus
3, 27, 54.-—quercus: typical of
long life. -te: object alike of re-
fugit and turpant, as the repeated
te makes clear. —- capitis nives: if
this metaphor was not invented
by Horace, it certainly is not much
older. Quintilian 8, 6, 17 con-

demns the figure as far fetched3
sunt et durae (translationes), id
est a longinqua similitudine ductae
ut capitis nives. To us it is com-
mon as snow itself, which Romans
saw much less often.

13 ff. Coae: the famous semi-
transparent silk of Cos was a fav-
orite stuff with women of Lyce's
class—notis condita fastis: i.e.
‘your years are safely stored away
and all can read the record3 you
cannot hope to hide them.’— volu-
cris dies: cf. 3, 28, 6 and 4, 7, 8
rapit hora diem.

18 ff. illius, illius: of her, of
lzer‚· partitive with quid—spira-
bat amores: cf. Epist. 2, 1, 166
nam spirat tragicum satis. Intr.
86.—-surpuerat: by syncope sor
the common surripuerat·
