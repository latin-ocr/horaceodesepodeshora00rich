CARMINA

[2, 17, 30

utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
consentit astrum: te Iovis impio
tutela Saturno refulgens
eripuit volucrisque fati

²5 tardavit alaS‚ curn populus frequens
laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum;
me truncus inlapsus cerebro
sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum

dextra levasset, Mercurialium

30 custos virorum.

21 ff. utrumque, etc. : cf. n. to v.
8 above. —consentit ε the passage
is imitated by Persius 5, 45 f. non
equidem hoc dubites, amborum
foedere certo Ι consentire dies et
ab uno sidere duci. —— te : the con-
trasted me follows v. 27. ‘Thou
art under the protection of supreme
Jove) Possibly in Maecenas'
horoscope Jupiter was in the as-
cendant. —impio . . . Saturno:
connect with both refulgens and
eripuit. According to the as-
trology of the time Saturn's influ-
ence was baneful. Cf. Prop. 5. 1,
84 <grrave Saturni sidus in amne
capum and our ‘jovial ' and ‘sat-
urnine.'—-refulgens: flashing out
against. Jupiter offsets Saturn's
power to harm.

24· volucris: with alas—fati:
here equivalent to mortis. Cf. S.
2, 1, 58 seu mors atris circumvo-
lat alis.

25 f. cum . . . crepuit: the
date was 30 B.c. For the occa-
sion, see n. to 1, 20, 4. —theatris2

. 13. — sustulerat :

Reddere victimas

locative abl.——-ter: a stock num·
ber. Cf. Prop. 4, 9, 4 Camenae

. . manibus faustos ter crepuere
sonos.

27 f. me truncus, etc.: cf. 2,
the indicative
emphasizes the certainty of Hor-
ace's fate which was suddenly
averted by Faunus. Cf. 3, 16, 3.

28 f. Faunus: the kindly wood-
land spirit, who loved to visit
Horace's farm and to care for his
flocks (1, 17), is named here as
protector. The Muses hold this
position 3, 4, 273 Liber 3, 8, 7. —-
Mercurialium, etc.: Mercury as
god of speech and inventor of the
lyre (3, ΙΙ, 1 ff.) is here made the
guardian of poets. Ordinarily the
phrase means the devotees of Mer-
cury, the god of gain, as S. 2, 3,
24 f. hortos egregiasque domos
mercarier un us l cum lucro noram .·
unde frequentia sidercuriale Ι in-
posuere mihi cognomen compita.

30· reddere: to pay, because
the offering vowed is due the gods.
