10 nutricis extra limina Pulliae
ludo fatigatumque somno
fronde nova puerum palumbes

texere, mirum quod foret omnibus,
quicumque celsae nidum Acherontiae
¹5 saltusque Bantinos et arvum
pingue tenent humilis Forenti,

ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis
dormirem et ursiS‚ ut premerer sacra

Coming in the scented breeze,{ Fed
thee, a child, lying alone, Ι With
whitest honey in fairy gardens
cull'd—1 A glorious child, dream-
ing alone, Ι In silk-soft folds, upon
yielding down, Ι With the hum of
swarming bees Ι Into dreamful
slumber lull'd.'

—fabulosae . . . palumbes: tlze
doves ‘ff story. Some, however,
connect fabulosae with nutricis.—
Volture: Mt. Voltur, near the bor-
ders of Apulia and Lucania—ex-
tra limina: the child had wandered
away into the wood‚ where he at last
fell asleep.—Pulliae: this is the
reading of some of the best MSS.,
and the name is found in inscrip-
tions. The other reading, limen
Apuliae, is impossible. — ludo, etc. ε
possibly modelled after the Ho-
meric (ll. 10, 983 Od. 12, 281) κα-
μάτῳ ἀδηκότες ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνῳ. For
the position of -que, see Intr. 31.—
fronde nova: freslz and fragrant.

13ff. mirum quod foret: (a sight)
to be a marvel ‚- expanded v. 17 ff.
ut . . . dormirem, etc. — nidum Ache-

rontiae: to-day, Acerenza, perched
like a nest on the top of a hill.
Many Italian towns were so placed
for defense, and still retain the ap-
pearance graphically described by
the word nidus. Cf. Cic. de Or. 1,
196 Ithacam illam z'n asperrimis
saxulis tamquam nidulum adfixam.
Macaulay, Horatius, 4 From many
a lonely hamlet, Ι Which, hid by
beech and pine, Ι Like an eagle's
nest, hangs on the crest Ι Of pur-
ple Apennine.' —saltus Bantinos:
the modern Abbadia de' Banzi,
on the side of the hill to the north
of Acerenza.— humilis Forenti:
the ancient town was in the low-
lands3 the modern Forenza, situ-
ated on a hill, preserves the name.

17ff. ut . . . dormirem, ut . . . pre-
merer: interrogative, the object
of their wonder. Notice the effect
of the interlocked order of the first
line. — atris: the ‘deadly' color.
Cf. 1, 37, 27 and n.—-sacra: the
laurel was sacred to Apollo, the
god of song, and the myrtle to
Venus; therefore their use fore·
