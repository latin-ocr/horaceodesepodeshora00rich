CARMINA [2, 1 7, 10

Horace's prophecy was fulfilled, for he outlived Maecenas but a short
time, both died in 8 B.C. The date of the occasions referred to in

25 ff. is 30 Bc Cf. 1, 2ο, 3 ff.; 2, 13. The ode was probably written
soon after. Metre, 68.

Cur me querellis exanimas tuis?
Nec dis amicum est nec mihi te prius
obire, MaecenaS‚ mearum
grande decus columenque rerum.

ς Α, te meae si partem animae rapit
maturior viS‚ quid moror altera,
nec carus aeque nec superstes
integer? Ille dies utramque

ducet ruinam. Non ego perfidum
10 dixi sacramentum: ibimus, ibimus,

1 f. exanimas: lzalsz'llme. Cf.
Epod. 14, 5 occidis saepe rogando.
—amicum est: the Greek φίλον
ἐστί, equivalent to placet.

3 f. obire: sc. diem supremum.
—— grande decus columenque: cf. 1,
1, 2 ο et praesidium et dulce decus
meum. The figure is old, eg.
Pindar 0. 2, 89 calls Hector Τροίας
κίονα, but Horace invented this
phrase, which in his verse is no
mere formal expression. It was
adopted by the later poets, Auso-
nius, Prudentius, and Apollinaris
Sidonius. Cf. eg. the last's C. 23,
2 Consenti columen decusque mo-
rum.— mearum . . . rerum: τὸ.
ἐμά, me and all l have.

5 f. partem animae: sc. al-
teram, 2'.e. the half. Cf. the term
of affection applied to Vergil 1, 3,
8 animae dimidium meae. — ma-

turior: too early, antimus—vis:
the same as 2, 13, 19 improvisa
leti vis. —altera: sc. pars, predi-
cate to moror.

7 f. carus: τῖε. misul—aeque:
‘as before thou wert snatched
away.'—superstes: modifying both
carus and integer.—integer: for
half his life will then be gone.—
utramque: with possessive force,
equivalent to utramque nostrum ru-
inam. Cf. the full form v. 21 below.

9. ducet: with a reminiscence
of the figure in columen, will drag
down. Cf. traho in the same
sense Verg. A. 2, 465 (turris)
elapsa repenle ruinam cum sonitu
trahit. — non ego: both emphatic.
Cf. n. to 1, 18, 11. The negative
affects perfidum alone.

10 f. dixi sacramentum: the
technical term sor the soldier's
