HORATI

Audiet civis acuisse ferrum,
quo graves Persae melius perirent,
audiet pugnas vitio parentum

rara iuventus,

Quem vocet divum populus ruentis

examples in Horace are 1, 25, 11

In the third and fourth books
‘this is avoided. For the careful
arrangement of the words in 18-20,
see Intr. 21.

21—24. Civil strife with its dis-
astrous results: ‘the second gen-
eration will hear with wonder the
story of their fathers' wanton
wickedness.' Notice that the
strophe forms a single group of

effect.

—civisz in the sense of fellow
citizens, ‘that citizens sharpened
sword against citizens.' —graves
Persae: the troublesome enemies
of the Romans. Crassus' disaster
at Carrhae was still unavenged‚

imperfect subj. of unfulfilled obli-

gation‚ ought rather to have per-
ishad.

parallel is the depopulation of
France by the Napoleonic wars.

25 ff. Horace now turns from
the portents sent by the gods, out-
raged at the nation's crime, to seek
for some divine aid3 for against
divine wrath human resources are
of no avail. —ruentisz rusln'ng to

27. minus audientem: a eu-
