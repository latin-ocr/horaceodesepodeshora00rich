2. 17, 31] HORATI

aedemque votivam memento;
nos humilem feriemus agnam.

Cf. 2, 7, 17 ergo oblzjgatam redde in their estate.
lovi dapem. —victimasz tle. many
large cattle.

32. humilem . . . agnam: in

playful reference ,to the difference

So Horace says
(4, 2, 53 f.) tc his rid-h friend
Julius Antonius le decem tauri
totidemque vaccae, Ι me tener sol·
vet vitulus.

‘No lordly pile or fortune great is mine, but a kind poetic gift, a
little farm, are all that Ι possess. 'Tis quite enough for me. But you,
though life is insecure, still build your palaces and grudge the very
sea its shore; you drive your poor clients from their homes that you
may satisfy your greed for land. Your sure home is the halis of Death3
Earth's doors open for rich and poor alike. No bribes move the grim
ferryman.'

This ode handles again Horace's favorite theme—the vanity of
riches and ambition, the wisdom of the golden mean. The same senti-
ments are expressed 1, 313 2, 163 3, 1,4o—48. 24, 1 ff. As frequently
elsewhere he takes his own case as an illustration of the ideal lot, in¹
which man is content with his moderate estate, and contrasts it with
that of the rich man whose greed defles the sacred laws of nature and
of man. Horace has no individual in mind, but with his fondness for
concrete statement gives his verses 3 dramatic turn by the direct form
of address. His model may have been a poem of Bacchylides, Frg. 21
Bl. οὗ βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός, Ι οὔτε πορφύρεοι τάπητες, Ι
ἀλλὰ θυμὸς εὐμενής Ι Μοῦσά τε γλυκεῖα, καὶ ,Βοιωτίοισιν Ι ἐν σκύφοισιν
οἶνος ἡδύς. The date of composition is uncertain. Metre (only here),
82.

Non ebur neque aureum

mea renidet in domo lacunar,

1—5. Horace has in mind the
splendid atria adorned with rare
marbles which the rich had begun
to build toward the end of the Re-
public. Cf. n. to 2, 15, 20.—
ebur: equivalent to the prose

eburneum3 ivory and gold were
used to adorn the panels (lacu-
naria) of the atrium. Cf. Lucr.
2, 27 f. nec domus argento fulget
auroque renidet Ι nec citharae re-
boant laqueata aurataque tecla
