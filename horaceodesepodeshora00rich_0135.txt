CARMINA [1‚ 27, b

27

A dramatic picture of acomz'ssatz'o at which the poet tries to check
his hot companions3 when they fill their cups and will make him drink,

he parries their impetuosity by refusing, unless his neighbor tell him the
name of his love. The whispered secret makes him exclaim in pity.

The ode is based on a similar one by Anacreon, according to Por-
phyrio 3 possibly the one of which Athenaeus (10, 42, 7) has preserved to
us a fragment (Frg. 63) ἄγε δηῦτε μηκέτ’ οὕτω Ι πατάγῳ τε κάλαλητῷ Ι ”
Σκυθικὴν πόσιν παρ’ οἴνῳ Ι μελετῶμεν, ἀλλὰ καλοῖς Ι ὑποπίνοντες ἐν ὕμνοις.
‘ Come. now, let us no longer with din and shout practice Scythian drink-
ing at our wine, but sip it while we blithely sing.7 The exhortation to
moderatiori in the use of wine (1-8) is similar to the theme of 1, 18.
