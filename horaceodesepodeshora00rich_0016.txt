During the next nine or ten years Horace received the ordinary
literary and rhetorical training 3 under the rod of the schoolmaster
Orbilius, whom ne 'aas iinmortalized with the adjective plagosus
(Epist„ 23 1ι, 70), he studied Latin literature, reading the works
of Livius Andronicus and ‘other old Roman poets, for whom he
apparently felt little admiration; his studies also included the
Iliad and probably other Greek classics, and we can hardly doubt
that this early study of Greek literature roused that enthusiasm for
it which lasted all his life.

In his twentieth year Horace went to Greece to finish his
studies at Athens, which had become a kind of university town
to which it was the fashion for young men of his generation to
resort. Among his fellow students wereCicero’s son, Marcus, and
M. Valerius Messala. During the next two years he heard lectures
by the leaders of the various philosophie schools, without being
seriously attracted by any one system. Speculative thought had
little interest for him, or indeed for his fellow countrymen in
general : questions relating rather to conduct interested the Roman
mind, and while Horace never gave himself up to any system os
ethics, Epicureanism attracted him at first3 on growing older
he turned more and more to the teachings of the Stoics, as the
Stoic maxims and paradoxes in his odes abundantly testify3
yet no one had a keener sense than he for what was absurd in
Stoic practice. His good sense always tempered his philosophy,
and in all matters of conduct he steered a middle course. It
is also most probable that during his stay in Athens he continued
his study of the Greek poets, particularly of Archilochus and the
early lyricists‚ especially Alcaeus and Sappho, who afterward be·
carne his chief models. At this time he was ambitious to excel
in Greek verse, but wisely forsook the practice later; yet his
consummate skill in handling his own language must have been
due to his early exercises in Greek. By studying in Athens he
had further the negative advantage of escaping the influence of

Alexandrianisrn which prevailed at Rome and affected all con-
