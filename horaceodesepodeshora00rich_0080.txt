This ode is very similar in construction to the fourth, in which the
first twelve verses are given to the praise of spring, the remainder of
the ode to the exhortation to enjoy life while we may: in this, 1-14

separate poems, and they so appear in some manuscripts, but that the
two parts belong together was recognized by Porphyrio, who notes on v.
