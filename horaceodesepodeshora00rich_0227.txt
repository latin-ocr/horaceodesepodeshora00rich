CARMINA

[2, 2ο, ιο

dilecte MaecenaS‚ obibo,
nec Stygia cohibebor unda.

Iam iam residunt cruribus asperae
10 pelles et album mutor in alitem
superne nascunturque leves
per digitos umerosque plumae.

Iam Daedaleo notior Icaro
visam gementis litora Bospori
15 Syrtisque Gaetulas canorus
ales Hyperboreosque campos,

51. urbis: the plural is more
effective than the simple terram
would have been. —non ego . . . non
ego: intensive3 Intr. 28c.—pau-
perum sanguis parentum: Horace
never was ashamed ofhis low birth,
but took a pardonable pride in his
success in raising himself to an
honored position by his own merits.
—vocasz invitest.

9ff. These—to us certainly—
tasteless verses may have been
suggested by Eurip. Frg. 911 N.
χρύσεαι δή μοι πτέρυγες περὶ νώτῳ Ι
καὶ τὰ σειρήνων πτερόεντα πέδιλα
[ἁρμόζεται], Ι βάσομαι τ’ εἷς αἰθέ-
ριον πόλον ἀρθεὶς Ι Ζηνὶ προσμείξων.
‘Golden wings are fastened on my
back and 1 have on the Sirens'
winged sandals. I shall go alost
to the aethereal sky to be with
Zeus.' But Horace has gone far
beyond his model. —iam iam: cf.
Epod. 17, 1.-—cruribus: abl. of
place—asperae pelles: the horny
skin of the bird’s legs and elaws
into which his burnan skin is set-

tling. —superne : with short ultima
as in Lucretius and Epist. 2, 3, 4.

11. leves z in contrast to asperae.

13 f. iam: presently. -— notior
Icaro: who gave his name to a sea.
Cf. Ovid. Fasti 4, 283 f. (mare)
Icarium, lapsas ubi perdidit alas Ι
Icarus et vastae nomz'nafecz't aquae.
-visam, etc.: ‘my farne will ex-
tend to the limits of the woi·ld.'——
gementis: cf.Verg. A. 5, 806 cun]
. . . gemerent repletiamnes. Soph.
Anttg. 592 στόνῳ βρέμουσι δ’ἀντι-
πλῆγες ἀκταί. Ten nyson, ln illem.
35 ‘the moanings of the homeless
sea.'

15 f. canorus ales: the swans are
called by Callimachus Hymn. in
Del. 252 Μουσάων ὄρνιθες, ἀοιδότα-
τοι πετεηνῶν. Vergil E. 9, 29 says
to his friend, Vare. tuum nomen.
. . . cantantes sublime ferent ad si-
dera cycni. — Hyperboreos z beyond
the North Wind was a mythical
folk said to live in unbroken peace
and happiness. But Horace means
only the distant North.
