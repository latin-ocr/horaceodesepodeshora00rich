eARMmA [3. 3, 2

3

The theme of the third ode is similar to that of the second: the
praise of two great virtues, institia and constantia, justice and stead-
fastness of purpose. The ode opens with the famous picture of the
upright and constant man who is unmoved by the fury of the populace
or by the raging elements; the fall of heaven itself would not shake
him (1-8). Such were the qualities which secured immortality for
Pollux, Hercules, Augustus, and Quirinus (9-16). Then with the men-
tion of Romulus Horace seems to turn from the theme with which he
began, and reports to us the speech of Juno before the council of the
gods, in which she gives up in part her hatred toward the Trojans and
their descendants, and prophesies for Rome an empire coterminous
with the world, so long as her people shall keep themselves from avarice
and not try to rebuild Ilium (17—68). Then he suddenly checks hirn-
self with a mock reproach to his lyre and muse for venturing on such
mighty themes (69—72).

The introduction of Juno’s long speech was apparently due to a
desire to avoid the lnonotony of a long moral discourse3 it further
allowed Horace to drive home the lesson he wished to teach by making
it part of Juno's prophecy. The protest against any attempt to rebuild
Ilium has puzzled commentators. Some take it to refer to a design to
move the capital to Ilium which rumor had attributed to Julius Caesar.
Cf. Suet. Dz'v. lul. 79 quin etiam varia fama percrebuit, megraturum
Alexandream vel Ilium, translatis simul opibus imperii. Others regard
it as an allegorical condemnation of Asiatic vice and luxury, which ,
Rome must avoid if she is to maintain her empire. Both views are
improbable. Horace wished to represent Juno's fateful wrath toward
Ilium as but partially appeased: she will allow the descendants of
the Trojans to rule, but only in exile.

The name Augustus (v. 11) shows that the date of composition is
after 27 B.c. Metre, 68.
