A lament on the death of Quintilius Varus, the common friend of
Horace and of Vergil. 'He was an accomplished and, according to
Horace's words, Epist. ἑ, 3, 438 ff, an impartial critic, whose judgment
was valued by his literary friends, Quintillo siquid recitares, ‘corsus
&odes ξ lme' aiebat ‘el hoc? melius sc posse negares, 1 bis terque eaper-
sum frastra, delere jubebat Ι et male tornatas incudi reddere versu.»
The year of his death is fixed by St. Jerome's entry against 24 Bc
Quintilius Cremonensis Vergy'lz' et Horati familiaris morilur. This
ode must have been written within the next few months. The Varus,
of the eighteenth ode is probably identical with Quintilius. Metre, 72.

Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
tam cari capitis? Praecipe lugubris
cantus, Melpomene, cui liquidam pater

vocem curn cithara dedit.

1. quis desiderio, eto: ἷζε. ‘who
can or would restrain his tears.‘
In prose we should have the geni-
tive depending on pudor, while the
dative is the natural case with
modus3 here the constructions are
united because modus contains the
predominant idea3 so in Martial
8, 64, 15 sit tandem pudor et
modus rapinis.

capum· Verg. A. 4, 354 puer As-
canius capitisqrte iniuria cari. So
in Greek, eg. ll. 8, 281 Τεῦκρε,
φίλη κεφαλῆς and in English,
Shelley, Adonal's, ‘Though our
tears Ι Thaw not the frost which
binds so dear a head.'—praecipe:
{each man—lugubris: indicating
the character os the strains.

2. tam cari capitis: for a seul muse of Tragedy3 cf. n. to 1, 12,
