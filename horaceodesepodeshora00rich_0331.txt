CARMINA

[3‚ 29, 58

45 vel 5016 puro: non tamen inritum
quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque
diffinget infectumque reddet
quod fugiens semel hora vexit.'

Fortuna, saevo laeta negotio et

50 ludum insolentem ludere pertinax,
transmutat incertos honoreS,

nunc mihi, nunc alii benigna.

Laudo manentem : si celeris quatit

pennaS, resigno quae dedit et mea
55 virtute me involvo probamque
pauperiem sine dote quaero,

Non est meum, si mugiat Africis
malus procelliS, ad miseras preces

get : clmngre. — infectum reddet:

49 ff. cf. Dryden's famous para-
phmse, ‘Fortune that with mali-
cious joy Ι Does Man, her slave,
oppress, Ι Proud of her office to
destroy‚ Ι Is seldom pleased to
bless: Ι still various, and incon-
stant still, Ι But with an inclination
to be 111, Ι Ρ101110165, degrades, de-
lights in strife, Ι And makes a lot-
16111 of life. Ι Ι can enjoy her
while she's kind3 Ι But when she
dances in the wind, Ι And shakes
her wings and will not stay, Ι Ι
puff the prostitute away: Ι The
little or the much she gave, is
quickly resigned, Ι Content with
poverty my soul Ι 31111, Ι And vir-
tue, though in rags, will keep me
warm.'

52. mihi: Horace here lapses

ways winged: cf. 1, 34, 15· —re-
