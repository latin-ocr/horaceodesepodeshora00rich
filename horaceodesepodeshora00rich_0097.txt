7 f. temere :blz'ndly, being spell-
bound by Orpheus' music. For
the story of Orpheus' power, cf.
Apoll. Rhod. Ι, 28 ff. φηγοὶ δ’
ἀγριάδες, κείνης ἕ τι σήματα μολπῆς,
Ι ἀκτῆς θρηικίης Ζώνης ἔπι τηλε-
θόωσαι Ι ἑξείης στιχόωσιν ἐπήτρι-
μοι ἂς ὅγ’ ἐπιπρὸ Ι θελγομένας
φόρμιγγι κατήγαγε Πιερίηθεν.
·But the wild oaks —even to-day
memorials of that song —grow on
Zone, the Thracian promontory,
and stand there in rows close to-
gether3 the oaks that Orpheus
charmed with his lyre and brought
down from Pieria.' Also Shake-
spere, Henry Ezglzllz 3, 1 ‘Orpheus
with his lute made trees, Ι And
the mountain tops that freeze‚!
Bow themselves when he did
sing: Ι To his music, plants and
flowers Ι Ever sprung3 as sun and
showers Ι There had made a last-
ing Spring.‘

9ff. Cf. 3, 11, 13 f. tu potes
tzgris comitesque silvas Ι ducere et
rz'vos celeris morari. - materna:

lle. of Calliope—blandum . . .
ducere: for the dependent infinitive
Porphyrio compares 1, 10, 7 calli-
dum condere—auritas: prolepti-
cal, ⁴ with charm to give ears* to the
oaks and draw them after him.'

ples reverses the order of v. 1 ff.

ἀοιδοὶ Ι ἄρχονται Διὸς ἐκ προοι-
μιου. And Aratus Phaen. 1f. ἐκ
Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα . . ., τοῦ γὰρ καὶ
γένος ἐσμέν. Also Verg.'E. 3, 60

may be compared with that of
Thracian Orpheus.
