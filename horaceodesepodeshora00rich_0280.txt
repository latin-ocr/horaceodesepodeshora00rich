In Trajan's reign a woman touring
in Egypt scratched this reminis-
cence of Horace's wor‘ds on the
pyramid at Gizeh, CIL. 3, 21, Vidi
pyramidas sine te, dulcissime fra-
ter, Ι et tibi quod potui, lacrimas hic
maesta profudi Ι et nostri memo-
rem luctus lzanc sculpo querelam.

of verses by Alcaeus, of which the opening line is preserved (Frg. 59)
ἔμε δείλαν, ἔμε πασᾶν κακοτατῶν πεδέχοισαν. The details, however, as

¹ usual, are Roman. Metre, 83. 6
