tropaea as a general term, defined
by what follows—Niphaten, Me-
dum flumen . . . volvere, Gelonos . . .
equitare. It is probable, however,
that Horace had no definite victo-
ries in mind, but wished to say,
‘Come, Valgius, let us turn to epic
song3 our subject is ready—Au—
gustus' new successes (in general)
and (in particular) the Niphate5,'
etc.

20 ff. These were victories of
diplomacy rather than of arms.—
rigidum : ice-bouna'. — Niphaten:
according to Strabo and Dio Cas=
sius, a mountain of Armenia. But
Lucan 3, 245 and Sil. Ital. 1 3, 765 and
Iuv. 6, 409 consider it a river. Verg.
G. 3, 30 celebrates the same exten-
sion of the empire, addam urbes
Asiae domitas pulsumque Nipha-
ten.—-Medum flumen: the Euphra-
tes. The construction changes
from the simple accusative to the
accusative and infinitive, ‘sing the

Niphates, sing that,' etc. Proper·
tius has a similar construction, 2,
1, 19 ff. non ego Titanas canerem,
nan Ossan Olympo Ι inpositam, ut
caeli Pelion esset iter Ι . . . Xerxis
et imperio bina coisse vada.—mi-
nores: in token of its submission.
Cf. Verg. Α. 8, 726 Euphrates ibat
iam mollior undis.

23. Gelonos: a nomad Scythian
people on the river Don. The
poets of this time, however, use
their name for the Scythians in
general.—exiguis: for they are
now limited intra praescriptum. —
equitare: ride their raia's. Cf. 1,
2, 51. The reference in the last
two verses is probably to an em-
bassy from the Scythians which
Augustus received at Tarraco in
Spain. Cf. Mon. Anc. 5, 51 nostram
amicitiam petierunt per legatos
Bastarnae Scythaeque et Sarma-
tarum qui sunt citra flumen T a-
naim et ultra reges.
