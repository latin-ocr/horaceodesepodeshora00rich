CARMINA

[4, 8, ¹7

gaudes carminibus; carmina possumus
donare et pretium dicere muneri.
Non incisa notis marmora publicis,
per quae spiritus et vita redit bonis

15 post mortem ducibus, non celeres fugae
reiectaeque retrorsum Hannibalis minae,
non incendia Carthaginis impiae

Censorinus is rich enough to buy
these rare things if he desired,
but is too simple in his tastes to
wish them. —deliciarum: curios,
with disparaging force.

11. Horace will bring a gift
which will please his friend, but
such as money cannot buy.

12. pretium dicere muneri: tell
tlte worllt of, set a price θη. The
common expression is pretinm
statuere, ponere. The following
verses state the worth. The thought
is the same as in Epist. 2, 1, 248 ff.

13 ff. ‘ Neither inscribed statues
nor great deeds in war have se-
cured Scipio the fame which he
has gained from Ennius' poem.'——
notis . “. . publicis ε inscriptions
cnt at llze slate's orders‚· instru-
menta] abl.—marmora: the fol-
lowing clause shows that this in-
cludes both the statues and their
bases on which the inscriptions
are engraved. Translate simply,
marbles. — spiritus et vita: a
double expression of a single idea,
yet somewhat more comprehen-
sive than either word would be
alone3 cf. 4, 2, 28 more modoque.
Also with the general sentiment,
cf. Verg. A. 6, 847 f. excudent alii

spirantia mollius aera, Ι credo equi-
dem, vivos ducent de marmore
voltus. — non fugae, reiectae minae,
incendia: all these confer fame,
and might secure the memory of
the leader under whom they were
accomplished3 yet all are inferior
to song—fugae: from Italy or
aster the battle of Zama, or both.
-reiectae . . . minae: Hanni-
bal's threats against Rome were
hurled back by the reduction of
Carthage. —- incendia, etc. z ‘this‘
verse has troubled critics, both
because it has no diaeresis and
because the burning of Carthage
was not accomplished until 146
B.C., when the Scipio who brought

the Second Punic war to an end
had been dead for thirty—seven,

and Ennius, who celebrated his
fame, for twenty-three years. It
was the younger Scipio Aemilia-
nus who razed Carthage. How-
ever, Horace may have consciously
taken the name Scipio Africanus
— inherited by the younger —

simply as typical of one who had

won great fame in war. Yet vv.
18 f. can strictly only apply to the
elder Scipio.

—- impiae: cf. n. to 4, 4, 46.
