CARMEN SAECVLARE

one proposed by Augustus was then the fifth, and fell in the last year
of the saeculum instead of at its close. Claudius celebrated the festival
in 47 A.D., taking the traditional date of the founding of the city as his
starting point and reckoning a saeculum as 1oo years, Domitian's cele-
bration was in 88 A.D.; that of Antoninus Pius, in 147, marked the
close of the city's ninth century. Later celebrations were by Septimius
Severus in 2043 by Philip in 248 in honor of the completion of the first
millennium of the state. Whether there were celebrations by Gallienus
in 257 or by Maximian in 304 is uncertain. They were revived by Pope
Boniface as papal jubilees in 1300. ·

Augustus, however, made important changes in the nature of the
festival. Hitherto it had been a propitiatory offering to the gods of
the lower world3 now it became rather a festival of thanksgiving for
present blessings and of prayer for the continuance of them forever.
Pluto and Proserpina were not mentioned, but Apollo and Diana
had the most prominent place. Jupiter and Juno were also honored.
Zosimus (2, 5) has preserved for us an account of the celebration and
the oracle which contains directions for it. This oracle in its present
detailed form was unquestionably written for the festival or after it, but
is probably based on an earlier production. After the celebration was
past, two pillars, one marble, the other bronze, inscribed with a com-
plete record, were erected at the spot Terentum3 in 1890 some frag-
ments of the marble pillar were recovered and are now preserved in the
Museo delle Therme which occupies a portion of the remains of the

- baths of Diocletian.1 These fragments and literary notices, especially

Zosimus, enable us to trace the course of the festival clearly. The cele-
bration proper began on the evening before June 1 ς but on May 26-28
the magistrates distributed to all citizens who applied suffimenta, pitch-
pine‚ sulphur, and bitumen, for purposes of purification3 May 29—31 the
citizens brought contributions of grain to the officials to be used by
them in paying the musicians and actors.

The festival itself lasted three nights and days: the nocturnal sacri-
fices were at Terentum3 the ceremonies by day were at the temples of
the several divinities. Augustus, assisted by Agrippa, conducted the
entire celebration. On the first night nine black ewe lambs and nine
she—goats were burnt whole in sacrifice to the Parcae (C. S. 25 ff.);
on the following night consecrated cakes were offered to the Ilithyiae
