THE ooEs ’ [5 7

¹7. Arrangement and Character of the Odes.—In arranging his
lyrics for publication, Horace placed at the beginning eleven odes,
each in a different metre, illustrating all the measures employed by
him in the three books with the exception of the unique rhythms
in 2, 183 3, 12.l Within this group certain other principles ot
arrangement can be detected. The first word is Maecenas, and
the opening poem virtually dedicates the three books to their
author's friend and patron, to whom he had already inscribed his
Satires and Epode’S. The second ode celebrates Octavian as the
divine restorer of order in the state, the third is a farewell poem
to Vergil3 the fourth is addressed to Sestius, consul in the year of
publication. The others are arranged to secure variety in subject
as well as measure, a principle that is observed generally through-
out the three books, so that grave themes are relieved by light,
and a succession of similar metres is for the most part avoided.
The second book opens with an ode to Asinius-Pollio, celebrating
his literary powers and touching sadly on the Civil Wars of which
Pollio was about to undertake a history. Iri the first >six odes of
the third book, Horace comes forward as the teacher of mentm
generatijon, and deals earnestly with the problems and dangers of
the state. This is the largest group of odes on related themes,
and the Alcaic metre is used in all, but, as if to avoid wearying his
reader, Horace did not insert another ode in the same measure
until the seventeenth. He had also some regard for chronological
sequence, but this was always subordinate to the principle of
variety. Each book, too, has certain characteristiCS. In the first
there are a larger number of studies from the Greek than in the
other two; about half the odes are on themes of love and wine;
nowhere is any serious philosophy of‘life presented 3 and only five
(2, 12, 14, 35, 37) show deep concern with the state. As if to
emphasize his character as the singer of light themes, and at the
same time to offset the serious notes in odes 35 and 37, Horace

1 The tenth ode, while in Sapphic measure like the second, still exhibits
certain metrical peculiarities.
