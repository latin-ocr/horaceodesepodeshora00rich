CARMIN A

A welcome horne to Pompeius, Horace's old companion in arms.

‘Who has restored thee to thy home, Pompeius mine, with whom I
once endured the dangers of the field and shared the joys of revelry
(1-8)? The hurry of Philippi's rout we knew together. Yes, I ran
away and saved myself— thanks be to Mercury. But thee war's tide
swept off upon the sea of further trouble (9-16). Come then, make
sacrifice and drain full cups of wine saved up against thy coming.
Away with all restraint, for thou art home again (17—28)!'

We know nothing more of Pompeius than the ode tells us. Appar-
ently Horace had not seen his friend from the year of Philippi (42 Rc.)
to the time at which the ode was written3 this was most probably 29
B.c., when Augustus' mild policy allowed those who had taken arms
against him to return to Italy in safety. Metre‚ 68.

O saepe mecum tempus in ultimum
deducte Bruto militiae duce,
quis te redonavit Quiritem
dis patriis Italoque caelo,

ς Pompei, meorum prime sodalium,
cum quo morantem saepe diem mero
fregi coronatus nitentis
malobathro Syrio capillos?

1. saepe: possibly somewhat
of an exaggeration for the two
years preceding Philippi.—tem-
pus in ultimum : ἷζε. into extremest
peril. So Catullus, 64, 151, and

169, uses tempus supremum, tem·
pus extremum.

2 f. deducte . . . duce: a play
on words similar to that in v. 7
fregi and v. 11 fracta.— redonavit :
found only here and 3, 3, 33, where
the sense is different. Stronger

than the common reddere.—

Quiritem: τῖε. a citizen, with no
loss of civic rights.

5ff. Pompei: dissyllabic, Intr.
38.—prime: in point of timei
earliest. —- morantem . . . diem
. . . fregi: cf. Tennyson ln Mem.
79 ‘And break the livelong sum-
mer day Ι With banquet in the
distant woods.'—coronatus: a
middle participle. Intr. 84.—
malobathro Syrio: connect with
nitentis. malobathrum is the
Latinized form of the Indian
