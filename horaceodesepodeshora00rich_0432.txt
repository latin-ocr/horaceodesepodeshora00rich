Romanus arcis ureret,

numquam nisi in dispar feris.

Furorne caecus an rapit vis acrior

or to extend the Roman empire,

tion of their own state. — invidae :
cf. Sall. Cat. 10, 1 Carthago
aemula imperi Romani ab stirpe
interiit.

7 f. intactus Britannus: practi-
cally true, as Caesar's expeditioris
to Britain had had no practical
results. Cf. Tac. Agric. 13 {gitur
primus omnium Romanorum di-
vus Iulius cum exercilu Britan-
niam z‘ngressus, quamquam pros-
pera pugna terruerit incolas ac
litore potitus sit, potest videri Os-
tendz'sse posteris, mm tradz'dszse.

and from Antony in 36 ΒΕ. Cf.
C. 3, 5,5ff.3 6, off.; 415, off„
and the notes on these passages.
—sua : emphatic. With the ex-
pression in these two verses, cf. 16,
1—10.

11 f. hic . . . mos: tle. of de-
stroying their own kind. — dispar:
used substantively, equivalent to
dispar animab—feris: here an
adjective, agreeing with lupis and
