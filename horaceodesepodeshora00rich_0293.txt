CARMINA [3, 17, 8

These verses are addressed to L. Aelius Lamia, apparently the friend
named 1, 26, 8 (cf. 36, 8). The Lamian family was not prominent
before Cicero's time and the name does not appear in the consular fasti
until 2 A.D.; during the first century of our era, however, the house
was one of the most distinguished. The Lamus to whom Horace play-

fully refers his friend's ancestry is none other than Homer's cannibal

king of the Laestrygonians, Od. 10, 81.
Metre, 68.

-place3 the occasion unknown.

The scene is Lamia's country

scendants.'——hinc: tle. ab Lamo;
