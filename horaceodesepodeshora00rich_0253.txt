[3, 4» 67

Volcanus, hinc matrona Iuno e„
60 numquam umeris positurus arcum,

qui rore puro Castaliae lavit
crinis solutOS, qui Lyciae tenet
dumeta natalemque silvam,
Delius et Patareus Apollo.

65 Vis consili expers mole ruit sua:
vim temperatam di quoque provehunt
in maius; idem odere viris

Jove-avidus: cf. the Homeric
λιλαιόμενοὶ πολέμοιο ll. 3, 133.
Verg. A. 9, 661 avidus pugnae. —
numquam umeriS, etc.: cf. 1, 21,
11 f. (tollite laudibus) inszgnemque
pharetra Ι fraternaque umerum
lyra. In Eurip. Alc. 40 Apollo
says, in answer to the question
why he has his bow and arrows
with him, σύνηθες αἰεὶ ταῦτα βασ-
τάζειν ἐμοί.

61 ff. Cf. Pind. P. 1, 39 Λύκιε
καὶ Δάλοι’ ἀνάσσων Φοῖβε, Παρνασ-
σοῦ γε κράναν Κασταλίαν φιλέων.
Also Stat. Τ heb. 1, 696 ff. Plzoebepa-
rens, seu te Lyciae Patarea nivosis
Ι exercent dumeta iuga, seu rore
pudico l Castaliae flavos amor est
tibi mergere crines. ——Castaliae : a
spring on Mt. Parnassus ς for a va-
riation of the place, cf. 4, 6, 26 qui

lian legend of Apollo, the god spent
the six summer months on the
island, but withdrew for the other
six to Patara, in Lycia. —natalem

born.

65 ff. vis consili expers, etc.: these
words sum up what has preceded.
—‘mere force, blind rebellion. un-
directed by wisdom, is sure to fail 3
but when properly guided it enjoys
the favor of the very gods, who yet
abhor and punish reckless strength
that urges men to wickedness. We
have as a proof of this the cases of
Gyas, Orion, and the rest, whose
lawlessness brought on thern the
divine wrath.'

— mole ruit sua : rushes to ruin
of its own wezglzt. For this mean-
ing of ruo, cf. n. to 1, 2, 25. With
this sententia, cf. Eurip. Frg. 732
ῥώμη δέ τ’ ἀμαθὴς πολλάκις τίκτει

καὶ μεγάλαυχον (the boastful) ἔσ-
φαλεν ἐν χρόνῳ

trasted both by position and mean-
ing with thepreceding. Intr. 28c.
