EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION [ξι

temporary poets. There, t00, he made many friendships which
lasted him through life.

In the autumn of 44 B.C. Brutus came to Athens, where the
people received him with enthusiasm as a liberator. The young
Roman nobles and Horace as well were attracted to his cause.
Why the freedman’s son was given the office of military tribune in
the conspirators' army—a position-for which he had no training—
it is hard to say, and the appointment not unnaturally aroused
envy at the time. It is probable, however, that Horace had
already made some reputation among his fellow students as a
skillful versifier, and Brutus' love of literature induced him to
prefer the youth. Of Horace's military service we know little;
his writings show a familiarity with some islands of the Aegean
and the famous cities of Asia, which was probably gained at this
time, and it is certain that he shared in the defeat at Philippi in

ι 42 ss.c. No doubt he gave as good an account of himself during

his two years of service as his fellows3 the ironical description of
his ssight at Philippi (C. 2, 7, 9 f.) is imitated from Archilochus
and Alcaeus, and is not to be taken seriously.

The defeat of the conspirators' cause brought a crisis to Horace's

political or social ambitions he may have cherished. He gradually
accepted the new order of things, at first despairing of the state ;
but later, after the battle of Actium had freed Rome from external
dangers, he enthusiastically proclaimed the permanence of the
Empire and celebrated the beneficence of Augustus’ rule. But
his entire life after his experience at Philippi was that of a man of
letters, who mixed much with men rather as an observer than as a
participant in their life. His later history falls into three periods
of about ten years each: first, from his return to Rome to ²9 13.c.,
the period during which he published his two books of Satires and

the collection of Epodes: second, 29-19 B.c., the period of a

his maturity, in which his genius reached its height. During
