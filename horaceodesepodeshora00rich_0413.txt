EPODON

LIBER [2‚ 70

⁴65 positosque vernaS‚ ditis examen domUS,
circum renidentis Laris.
Haec ubi locutus faenerator Alfius,
iam iam futurus rusticus,
omnem redegit Idibus pecuniam;
70 quaerit Kalendis ponere.

65. positosque vernas : tlte
home-born slaves in tlzez‘r places
(at supper). Vernae were slaves
born within the house, not bought
from abroad. Such were highly
prized, sold only from necessity,
and formed an important part of a
well-to-do house. Cf. Tibul. 2, 1,
2 3 turbaque vernarum, saturi bona
szgna coloni. On the scansion of
positos, see Intr. 58.

66. renidentis : the polished
images of the household gods,
placed about the hearth. reflect the
firelight and seem to share in the
satisfaction of the scene.

67 ff. Horace breaks off with
this unexpected turn which is not
fully understood until the last line
is reached, as if he would say:
‘But Ι am getting too serious.
Any man, even an Alfius, can

talk this way, and yet have no
real feeling for the country3 his
enthusiasm will not last a fort-
night.⁷ It is a favorite method
with Horace to hide a deeper pur-
pose behind an apparently light
expression.

——locutus: sc. est.——A1fius: a
well known faenerator of Cicero's
day, whom Horace takes as typical.
—iam iam: intensive, in [τοί haste
to. Cf. Tac. Anu. 1, 47, 5 iam
iamque iturus. —idibus. . . kalen-
dis: settlements were made and
new arrangements entered into
regularly on the Calends, Nones,
or Ides. Alfius called in (redegit)
his money on the Ides, but before
the Calends of the next month
came, repented of his enthusiasm
for country life, and tried to invest
(ponere) his wealth again.

With comic pathos and extravagance Horace inveighs against garlic,
declaring that it is worse than all the drugs and poisons known. The
occasion of Horace's indignation seems to have been a fit of indigestion
caused by a salad, of which garlic had been an ingredient‚ offered him

at Maecenas' table.

In his distress he calls down vengeance on his

friend. This epode was written after Horace had acquired an intimate

footing with his patron.
