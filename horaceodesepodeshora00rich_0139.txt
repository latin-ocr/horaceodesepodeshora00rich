CARMINA

[1, 28, 12

Occidit et Pelopis genitor, conviva deorum,
Tithonusque remotus in auras,
et Iovis arcanis Minos admissus, habentque
10 Tartara Panthoiden iterum Orco
demissum, quamvis clipeo Troiana refixo
tempora testatus nihil ultra

the less) Cf. 2, 3,4 moriture Delli
and n. Intr. 23.

6f. Examples to prove the gen-
eral statement implied in morituro,
‘all must die.'—occidit: emphati-
cally presenting the 'main idea—
dead too is, etc. Cf. ll. 21, 107
κάτθανε καὶ Πάτροκλος, ὅπερ σέο
πολλὸν ἀμείνων. — Pelopis genitor:
Tantalus, who shared the very ta-
ble of the gods until their favor
made him arrogant. Cf. Pind. 0.
1, 54 f. εἰ δὲ δή τιν’ ἄνδρα θνατὸν
Ὀλύμπου σκοποὶ Ι ἐτίμασαν, ἧν
Τάνταλος οὗτος. ‘If the guardians
of Olympus honored any mortal,
that man was Tantalus.⁷ Eurip.
Orest. 8 ff. (Τάνταλος) ὡς μὲνλζγου-
σιν, ὅτι θεοῖς ἅνθρωπος ὢν Ι κοινῆς
τραπέζης ἀξιωμ’ ἔχων ἴσον, Ι ἀκό-
λαστον ἔσχε γλῶσσαν, αἰσχιστην
νόσον. Men say that because Tan-
talus, though mortal, shared their
table with the gods in equal honor,
he had an unbridled tongue, most
shameful plague.' And Anllz. Lat.
931, 9 f. Tantalus zbzfelzlr, dicunt,
conviva deorum Ι nunc quoque
apud Manes victima sacra lavi es.

8. Tithonus: Laomedon's son
and brother ofPriam. He was loved
by Eos, who obtained for him from
Zeus the gift of immortality, but

forgot to ask the boon of eterna]

youth3 so Tithonus wasted away
until he was a mere voice. Cf. 2, 16,
30 longa Tithonum minuit senec-
tus. Mimnermus Frg. 4 Τιθωνῷ
μὲν ἔδωκεν ἔχειν κακὸν ἄφθιτον ὁ
Ζεὺς Ι γῆρας, ὃ καὶ θανάτου ῥίγιον
ἀργαλέου. “’ To Tithonus Zeus
granted an eternal bane, old age,
which is more painful than grievous
death.' ¹

9. Minos: Od. 19, 179 Διὸς με-
γάλου ὀαριστής (“’ the friend ³). He
was instructed by Jove himself in

the laws which he gave the Cretans.

10 ff. Tartara: here the place
of the dead simply, equivalent to
HadeS, Orcus. So Verg. G. 1, 36,
nam le nec sperant Tartara regem.
—- Panthoiden: Euphorbus, who
was killed by Menelaus (ll. 17, 1—
60). His shield was hung up in
the temple of Hera at Argos. Now
Pythagoras claimed that he was the
reincarnated Trojan hero, and to
prove his claim went to the temple
and took down Euphorbus' shield,
recognizing it as the one he had
carried when formerly on earth.
Yet his reincarnation could not save
him from a second return to Orcus
(iterum Orco demissum), although
he yielded not his spirit, but only
