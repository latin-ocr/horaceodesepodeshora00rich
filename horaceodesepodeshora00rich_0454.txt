parentibusque abominatus Hannibal,
impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetaS‚
ιο ferisque rursus occupabitur solum.
Barbarus heu cineres insistet victor et urbem
eques sonante verberabit ungula,

Teutones and Cimbri, who were
defeated and cut to pieces by
Marius at Aquae Sextiae in 102 Bc„
and at Versellae in the following
year.—caerulea: blzce-eyed. The
blue eyes and fair hair of the
Germans excited the wonder of
the dark Italians. Cf. Iuv. 13,
164 f. caerula quis stupuit Ger-
mans lumina, flavam Ι caesariem?

8. parentibus abominatus: cf.
C. 1, 1, 24 bella matribus detestata.

9 f. impia . . . aetas: in oppo-
siti on with the subject of perdemus.
Cf. C. 1, 35, 34 quid νιος dura
refitgz'mus aetas .? -— devoti san-
guinis: wz'tlz a taint in tlze blood,
caused by the scelus fraternae
necis 7, 18. — rursus: as before the
founding of Rome.

11 f. barbarus: the Parthian
particularly was in Horace's mind,
as eques in the following verse
shows. Cf. 7, 9. —cineresz z'.e.
of fallen Rome. Aecus. with in-
sistet. —sonantez ‘and the boofs
of the victor's horse will clatter
and echo through the empty
streets.' Cf. Ezek. 26, 11 ‘with
the hoofs of his horses shall he
tread down all thy streets.'

13. carent: now are safe from.
Tradition placed the tomb of Ro-
mulus—in spite of his apotheosis
—behind the rostra. So Porph.
Varro post roslra fuisse sepultum
Romulum dicit. Wb eth er it was at
the spot marked by a slab of black
stone was uncertain, according to
Festus, p. 177 M. mger lapis in
Comitio locum funestum szssgralficat,
nt alsi, Romuli morti deslz'nalmn.
In 1899—1900 the spot beneath this
ηζξνεν lapis was excavated, but
nothing that could be regarded as
a tomb of a hero was discovered,
yet the place was clearly hallowed,
as the remains of sacrifices show.
The most important discovery was
a fragmentary ancient inscription,
which can hardly be later than
500 B.C.

14. nefas videre: sc est. Said
with reference to the entire act of
desecration. — insolens : all un-
willingly. Cf. C. Ι, 5, 8. With
the expression in the last two
verses, cf. Jeremiah 8, 1 ‘At that
time, saith the Lord‚ they shall
bring out the bones of the kings
of Judah, and the bones of his
princes, and the bones of the
