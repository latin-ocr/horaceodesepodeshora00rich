terna . . . lyra: the story of the
presentation of the lyre to Apollo
by Mercury is told in the Homeric
H ymn to Hermen 490-502.

13 ff. hic . . . hic: Apollo as the
special protector of Augustus is in-
voked to avert the ills that threaten
the state. Cf. the introductory
note to 1, 2. —bellum lacrimosum:

the failure of the crops in 24
B.C. and Augustus' sickness, 24—23
B.C. The collocation famem pes-
temque may be simply a repro-
duction of the phrase λιμὸς καὶ
λοιμός, Hes. Op. 243.—principe:
‘the first citizen.' Cf. Ι, 2, 50.—
Persas atque Britannos: the remote
East 'and West still unsubdued.

Cf. 3, 5, 3 adiectis Britannis 1 im-
perio gravibusque Persis. Note
the confidence expressed by the

future aget. 1 V

‘The upright man is safe, no matter where he roams.

Lalage, a monster -wolf fied from me. though Ι was unarmed. Put me
in chill northern gloom or beneath the torrid sun, still will I ever sing
my Lalage)

The affected solemnity of the first two strophes has often led com-
mentators to interpret this ode too seriously‚ as if Horace were sol-
emnly preaching a moral Iesson. While an actual encounter with a
wolf may have furnished the opportunity for the illustration‚ Horace
was the last man to use such an event to point a moral, still less take
himself for an example of the noblest virtue. He never preache5‚ and
is always free from cant. As a matter of fact. the ode is a piece of
humor which Horace knew his friend Aristius Fuscus would appre-
ciate. No doubt Horace had, had many proofs of Fuscus' fondnes.e
for joking; he tells of one occasion (S. 1. 9, 61-73) when his friend
refused to rescue him frorn a bore. The relations between the two
were the closest. Cf. Epist. 1, 10, 3 f. paene gemelli fraternis animis.
