CARMINA [4, 5, 5

bers her great benefactors. At morning and at eventide we pray that
thou wilt give thy country peace (29-40).'

For the military events that called Augustus from Rome in 16 ss.C.‚
see the introductory n. to 4, 2. It was also said (Dio Cass. 55, 19),
that the Emperor wished to withdraw from the city for a time, as Solon
once had done from Athens, until the unpopularity of his reform meas-
ures should have somewhat abated.· His return at an early date, how-
ever, was confidently expected3 when it was put off from time to time
— he did not come back until 13 Bc. —the feelings of the great body of
citizens were expressed by Horace in this ode. Peace had been so long
ree'stablished that its blessings were evident on every hand3 it was
natural that those who remembered the horrors of the civil wars should
have a lively feeling of gratitude to the Emperor who had brought
order out of chaos and had revived the weakened and impoverished
state. To th²s class Horace belonged3 in these verses he shows a
genuine warmth of feeling which is not found in his earlier odes to the
Emperor, and which his official position as laureate did not call forth.
The sense of security here expressed is in marked contrast to the hope-
less tone of 3, 6.

The ode is carefully polished3 the frequent cases of assonance and
alliteration should be noted. Its date cannot be absolutely determined‚

but may be approximately fixed as 14 B.c. It forms a pendant to 4, as
Ode ¹5 to 14. Metre, 72.
