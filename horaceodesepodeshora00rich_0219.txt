CARMINA

[2. 18, 14

ignotus heres regiam occupavi,

nec Laconicas mihi

satis beatus unicis Sabinis,

3 f. The architraves of this
splendid atrium are made of the
bluish white marble from Mt. Hy-
mestus, the columns of yellow
'gz'allo antico from Numidia.

5 f. neque Attali, etc. : the in-
heritance of great fortunes by per-
sons not related to the testator
was already known in Horace's
day. In the following century
inheritance hunting became a busi-
ness. The ancient commentators
believed that Horace here ex-
pressed his disapproval of the in-
heritance by the Romans of King
Attalus' wealth in 133 B.C. Whether
this be true or not, it is certain
that many ofthe conservative Ro-
mans dated the introduction of
&luxury and the consequent degen-
eracy at Rome from this time.—
ignotus: z‘.e. to the testator. The
heir has no right to the fortune he
greedily seizes.—occupavi: note
the greed expressed in this word.

7 f. ‘Nor am I so rich that Ῑ
have high-born clients to spin me
robes dyed with the purple.'—
Laconicas: the murex from which
the purple dye was obtained was
found in great abundance on the
shore of the island Cythera and
along the Laconian coast.

9 f. at: marking the sharp
transition to what the poet does
possess. — benigna z kindly. ——
pauperemque, etc. ε instead of
going to the rich man's house to
give him the morning greeting
(salutatio), Horace is visited in
his humble home by the rich who
honor his poetic talent.

12. lacesso: vex with my de-
mands,· with two accusatives as
a verb of asking. — amicum ε Mae-
cenas, as is shown by ν. 14.

14. satis beatus : enriched
enough ,· beatus has here an original
participial sense. Cf. Epod. 1, 31 f.
satis superque me benignitas lua ¹
