forumque vitat et superba civium
potentiorum limina.
Ergo aut adulta vitium propagine
ιο altas maritat populos,
aut in reducta valle mugientium
prospectat errantis gregeS‚
inutilisve falce ramos amputans

feliciores inserit,

aut tondet infirmas ovis3

Claudian Carm. min. 52, 7 f. non
freta mercator tremuit*9 non clas-
sica miles‚· Ι non rauci lites pertu-
lit illeforz'. —superba . . . limina:
referring to the morning call, salu-
tatio, and the humiliations to which
clients were exposed from their
patrous. Imitated by Seneca,
Epist. 68, 10 puhare superbas po-
tentiorum fores.

9. ergo : amiso, being free from
such cares. —adulta z according
to Columella, when three years old.
In this word lurks the figurative
sense -— ⁴ old enough for marriage.'
—propagine2 sltem, properly the
‘ layer ' by which new vines were ob-
tained. See ClassDict. s.v. vitis.

10. maritat populos: the black
poplar was considered second only
to the elm as a support for grape
vines. The ‘wedding' of the vine
and tree seems to have been a
farmer's expression that established
itself early in literature3 so Cato
says R. R. 32 arbores facito ut
bene maritae sint. Milton adopts

the figure P. L. 5 ‘ or they led the
vine Ι To wed her elm; she,
spoused, about him twines Ι Her
marriageable arms! The plane
tree which has a thick foliage was
unfitted for this purpose3 so C.
2, 15, 4 platanus caelebs.

11 f. in reducta valle: repeated
C. 1, 17, 17. Connect with er-
rantis—mugientium: used sub-
stantively like Vergil's balantum
gregem, G. 1, 272, for sheep.

13 f. ramos: of fruit trees.—
feliciores: more sruitsul. The
root appears in famina, fZ-cundas.
—inserit z grafts, a technical term.
Cf. insitiva, v. 19.

15 f. Note the alliteration.—-
pressa . . . mella: after as much
honey had drained out as naturally
would, the comb was pressed to
extract the remainder. Cf. Verg.
G. 4, 140 f. spumantia cogere
pressis mella favis. — infirmas:
weak, and so unresisting. A stock
epithet3 cf. Ovid. Jb. 44 pecus

infirmum .
