HORATI

nutriant fetus et aquae salubres

et Iovis aurae.

Condito mitis placidusque telo
supplices audi pueros, Apollo;
35 siderum regina bicornis audi,

Luna, puellas,

Roma si vestrum est opus Iliaeque
litus Etruscum tenuere turmae,
iussa pars mutare laris et urbem

ῃ sospite cursu,

cui per ardentem sine fraude Troiam
castus Aeneas patriae superstes

the prayer of Tibullus 1, 1, 15
stava Ceres, tibi sit nostro de rure
corona Ι spicea—fetus: restricted
to the fruges, as the context clearly
shows.

33 ff. In the previous strophes
the divinities worshipped by night
have been invoked3 the hymn is
now directed to the gods of light.
This strophe forms the transition.
—condito mitis, eto: logically
parallel to audi, —- replace thy
weapon, be kind, eto—telo: τῖε.
his arrow. Apollo was repre-
sented in his temple on the Pala-
tine (cf. 1, 29) as a gracious and
kindly god, not armed but playing
on the lyre. See Baumeister, no.
104.

35 f. siderum regina: cf. 1, 12,
47 f.—bicornis: tle. of the cres-

cent moon.
37 ff. The Aeneid, which had

recently been published, supplied
the theme of this and the follow-
ing strophe. Horace appeals to
the gods to protect their own crea-
tion. ——siz the condition expresses
no doubt, but has rather a causal
force,—7'f Rome is your work
(and it surely is); tle. ‘since
Rome, etc.'—vestrum: not re-
ferring to Apollo and Diana of
the preceding strophe, but mean-
ing the great gods who cared for
the destinies of the state. The
vagueness of the adjective must
be counted a defect.—tenuere:
gained—pars: tlte remnant3 in
apposition with turmae—laris:
‘their hearths and homes.'

41 f. fraude: harm. Cf. 2, 19,
20. —castus ι and therefore saved
while the wicked perished. Cf.
with the epithet, Vergil's pius.—
patriae: dative3 cf. Ep. 5, 10.
