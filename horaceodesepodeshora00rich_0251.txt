CARMINA

[3. 4, 50

Titanas immanemque turbam
fulmine sustulerit caduco

⁴⁵ qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat
ventosum et urbis regnaque tristia
divosque mortalisque turmas
imperio regit unus aequo.

Magnum illa terrorem intulerat Iovi
50 fidens iuventus horrida bracchiiS,

41 ff. vos: cf. n. on 37 above.—
lene consilium, etc. : with reference
to Augustus' mild and beneficent
policy after he had established his
position (cf. C. S. 51 iacentem lenis
in hostem). This policy of concili-
ation was in sharp contrast with
the proscriptions of Marius, Sulla,
and also of the second Trium-
virate, consisting of Antony,
Lepidus, and Octavian, to whose
hatred many fell victims in 43 Bc,
among them the orator Marcus
Cicero. — consilium: trisyllabic.
Intr. 39.—dato: sc. consilz'o; τῖε.
the Muses take delight in further-
ing the counsel that they have
given. —scimus‚ etc.: emphatic, we
all know. Horace thus suddenly
turns to his contemporaries and
reminds them that the lesson is in-
tended for them3 they must recog-
nize that foolish rebellion against
Caesar's kindly rule is as vain as
the attack of the Titans on Jove's
power.—fulmine . . . caduco: tlte
quick—fizlling bolt. So in Aesch. P.
V. 358 ff. it is said that the monster
Typhon was consumed by the κατ-

αιβάτης κεραυνός ἐκπνέων φλόγα.
—sustuleritz destroyed. The sub-
jectis the antecedent of qui in the
following verse.

45 ff. terram, mare, urbis, etc.:
indicating the universality ofJove's
rule. Observe also that the natu-
ral contrast of the nouns is height-
ened by the adjectives employed,
—inertem, brztte5 ventosum, gusty
(cf. 1, 34, 9 bruta tellus et vaga flu-
mina) ; tristia, gloomy, contrasted
with the cities of men. —temperatz
gaveras (in harmony). Cf. 1, 12,
16. Its objects are terram and
mare 3 the other nouns denoting
animate creatures belong with re-
git. —unus ε alane, emphasizing the
unity of the world's order.

49 ff. The possibility that Jove
should fear the giants is, strictly
taken, inconsistent with his uni-
versal rule described in the preced-
ing strophe; but Horace wished
to exalt (57 f.) the position of Pal-
las, the embodiment of wisdom, in
relation to the power of Jove.

50. fidens ε absolutely, presump-
tuens. —iuventus horrida bracchiis:
