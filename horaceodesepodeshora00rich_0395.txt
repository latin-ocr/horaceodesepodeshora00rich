CARMEN SAECVLARE [1—8
this was intentional and marked no falling off in Horace's skill as a
versifier. He saw that for this ceremonial occasion simplicity and dig-
nity were of chiefimportance. Any just appreciation of the poem on
our part must start with the consideration that it was written to be sung
to musical accompaniment by a trained chorus in the open air before a
large body of people. Thus performed it >must have been beautiful and
impressive. The ode is carefully polished, the number of feminine
caesuras is striking. It is impossible to determine to-day with accuracy
the way in which the strophes were assigned3 it is probable that the
first, second, and last were sung by the full chorus, and it is clear that
vv. 33-34 belong to the boys, 35-36 to the girls. Beyond this all is
mere conjecture. For the influence of the Aeneid in this ode, cf. n.
to vv. 37 ff. Metre, 69.

tions of Sibylline oracles were
destroyed at the burning of the
Capitol, 83 ss.C. A new collection
was made which was added to

itself.——1ectas, castos: both ad·-
