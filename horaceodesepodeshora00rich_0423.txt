25-28. Sagana is mentioned
also S. 1. 8, 25 as Canidia's assist-
ant. With dress tucked up (ex-
pedita Ξ succinta) she hurries like
a wild creature through the house,
sprinkling it with water from Aver-
nus in lustral preparation for the
infernal rites. The waters of Lake
Avernus, being near, as was sup-
posed, to an entrance to the lower
world, were especially appropriate
for such purposes as these. So
Vergil says of Dido, Α. 4, 512
sparserat et latices simulatos fontis
Averni. ,

29 f. Veia: her function is to dig
in the floor of the atrium the pit in
which the boy is to be buried. ——
ligonibus: plural, magnifying the
difficulty and intensity of her toi13
so laboribus in the following line.
— duris: pitiless‚ with ligonibus.
Cf. C. 3, 11, 31 duro perdereferro.

31. ingemens: showing the dif-
ficulty of her task. Cf. Verg. (i.
1, 45 f. depressa incipiat iam tum
milli taurus aratro Ι ingemere.

33. The food is to be changed
again and again (bis terque) to in-
crease the boy's longing‚ a refine-
ment of torture whereby the day is to
be made interminably long for him.

34. inemori: a compound found
only here: pz'ne lo death at (szgrlzt
of, eto). The in- has the same
force as in ingemens v. 31, or in the
simpler compound inumeri, [geist.
Ι, 7, 85. —spectaculoz dative like
laboribus,v. 31.

36 f. suspensa, etc. : an artificia]
expression for natantes.—exsecta,
aridum: modifying both substan-
tives. His marrow, his innermost
part. and his liver, the seat of the
passions. shall be cut out and dried
to form the basis of the philter.
