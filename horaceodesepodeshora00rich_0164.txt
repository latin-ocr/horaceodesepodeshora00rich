LIBER SECVNDVS

I

As the first three odes of the first book are given in order to) Maece-
nas, Octavianus, and Vergil, so this book opens with odes addressed to
three friends, Pollio, Sallustius Crispus, and Dellius. The place of
honor is given to C. Asinius Pollio, who was one of the most distin-
guished men of his time, born in 76 B.C. he belonged in his youth to‘

. the literary circle of Catullus, Calvus, and Cinna. He had an honorable

politica] and military career, attaining the consulship in 40 ss.c.; his
military services, in the course of which he served under Caesar and
after Caesar's murder under Antony, culminated in a successful cam-
paign against the Parthini, a tribe in Dalmatia, in 39 ss.C. With the
booty gained he founded the first public library in Rome.

From this time he gave himself up to literary and forensic pursuits,
maintaining with honor a neutral position in the struggle between
Octavianus and Antony. Quintilian, Seneca, and Tacitus praise his
oratory (cf. 13 f.) in which he had hoped to rival Cicero; his tragedies
(11-12) were celebrated in 39 ΒΕ. by Vergil (E. 8, 10) as sola Sophocleo
tua carmina dzgna cothurno. Horace refers to them in the verse (S.
1, 10, 42 f.) Pollio regum Ι facta cam't pede ter percusso. F ollowing pos-
sibly the example of Sallust, he undertook to write a history of the civil
wars, with the first triumvirate 60 Β. c„ as his starting point. We do
not know to what date Pollio intended to bring his work —it υῐιάοι,
edly included Pharsalus, Thapsus and probably Philippi, —or whether
he completed his plan. whatever it may have been; for while the work
is referred to by Tacitus and Suetonius. it is to us entirely lost. Our
knowledge of his literary ability is based solely on his letters to Cicero
(cuasam. 10, 31—33) which show a stiff and archaic style: an attempt
in recent years to ascribe to him the bellum Africum and a portion of
the bellum Alexandrmum has utterly failed. Pollio first introduced
the practice of reading portions of ones works to a circle of friends
(recitationes), which became a regular habit under the empire, and we
