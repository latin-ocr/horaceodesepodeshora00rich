HORATl

15 mella decedunt viridique certat

baca Venafro 3

ver ubi longum tepidasque praebet
Iuppiter brumas et amicus Aulon
fertili Baccho minimum Falernis

20 invidet uvis.

Ille te mecum locus et beatae
postulant arces, ibi tu calentem
debita sparges lacrima favillam

vatis amici.

15 f. decedunt: yield t0.—baca
ἷζε. the olive—Venafro: Vena-
frum, in Campania near Minturnae,
was famed for its olives.

17 ff. Ausonius four centuries
later praises his native Burdigala
in the same ternis ord. urb. nobil.
20, 9 f. ubi . . . ver longmn bru-
maeque nove cum sole tepentes. —
Aulon: it is disputed whether this
was a mountain or a valley near
Tarentum, but in all probability
it was a mountain side suited for
sheep grazing and the production
of grapes. Cf. Martial's descrip-
tion 13‚ 125 nobilis el lanis elfelm*
vitibus Aulon Ι det pretiosa tibi
vellera, vina mihi.

19. Baccho: dative with amicus.
-Falernisz cf. n. to 1, 27, 9.

21 ff. te mecum . . . postulant:
invite, returning to the sentiment
of the first strophe—beatae :
because of their rnild climate
and productiveness —ibi tu . . .
sparges: the future is half pro-

phetie and half appealing. Horace
will die first, he cannot bear to
lose his friend. Cf. the appeal
Anllz. Pal. 2, p. 855 J. μέμνεο κήν
ζωοῖς ἐμέθεν καὶ πολλάκι τύμβῳ 1
σπεῖσον ἀπὸ βλεφάρων δάκρυ’
ἀποιχομένη. ‘I pray thee remem-
ber me even among the living,
and let fall ofttimes from thine
eyelids tears on my grave as thou
turnest away.’

——calentern . . . favillam: when
the ashes of the dead were gath-
ered from the pyre and placed
in the funeral urn, wine and per-
fume were regularly sprinkled over
them, but Horace asks Septimius
for the tribute of the tear due their
friendship. -vatis amici: effec-
tively placed at the end, the last
word emphasizing the relation-⁴
ship between them. Cf.. however,
4, 6, 44 vatis Horati, where Horace
reserves the mention of his name
to the end for other reasons. See
n. on the passage.
