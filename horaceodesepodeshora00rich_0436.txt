HORATI

¹5 interque signa turpe militaria
sol adspicit conopium.
Ad hoc frementis verterunt bis mille equos
Galli canentes Caesarem,
hostiliumque navium portu latent
20 puppes sinistrorsum citae.
Io Triumphe, tu moraris aureos
currus et intactas boves?

15 f. turpe: a slzamejful seght,
with conopium. —sol adspicit: the
all-seeing sun is regularly invoked
as the witness of shameful deeds.
So by Aeschylus' Prometheus
in his suffering, P. V. 91 καὶ
τὸν πανόπτην κύκλον ἡλίου καλῶ.
Likewise by Shelley's, ‘ Ι ask you,
Heaven, the all-beholding sum}
Has it not seen?'— conopium: ‘a
mosquito bar‚' then a ‘canopied
couch.' Symbolical of the abomi-
nation of oriental luxury. Cf. the
similar passage in Propertius, who
is speaking of Cleopatra, 3, 9, 45
foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere
saxo (ausa).

17 f. ad hoc: (in disgust) at
this. — Galli: Galatians, led by
Amyntas and Deiotarus, who went
over to Octavian before the battle.
verterunt: Intr. 36. — canentes
Caesarem: cf. VergA . 7, 698 ibant
aequati numero regemque canebant.

19 f. The naval maneuver here
spoken of is not clearly under-
stood. Horace evidently refers to
a defection or at least a withdrawal
from active battle by a part of the
lieet, similar to the acti0n of the

Galatian cavalry. The ships seemed
to have abandoned the rest of the
fleet by making a turn to the left
(sinistrorsum citae).—citae: ap-
parently a real participle, equiva-
lent to the Greek κινηθεῖσαι.

21 f. io Triumphe: the shout
of the people to the personified
Triumph, as the procession ad-
vanced towards the Capitol. Cf.
C. 4, 2, 49. Horace already in
imagination sees Octavian in the
triumphal car. The triumph did
not actually take place until Aug.
13—15‚2913.c. Cf. Verg.A.8,714-
728.-aureos currus: the gilded
car of triumph, to be used in the
triumphal procession. With the
plural, cf. Ι, 2, 15 t.—intactas:
sc. ingo. Only cattle that had
not been broken to the service of
man could be used in sacrifice to
the gods. Cf. Verg. A. 6, 38
grege de intacto . . . mactare iu-
vencos. The reference here is to
the white bulls (the gender of
boves is due to custom) which
were driven in the triumphal pro-
cession and sacrificed to Jupiter
on the Capitol.
