4, 14, 1] HORATI

the brothers may have been intended to please Augustus, with whom
'Drusus was more of a favorite than his brother. The position of the
ode in the book is thought by many to be due to the same cause; but
it is more probable that Horace placed it and its companion ode, the
fisteenth, at the end, that he might close the book with the Emperor's

fourth ode, τῖε. 14 B.C. Metre‚ 68.
