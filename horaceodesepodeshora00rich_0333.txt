Exegi monumentum aere perennius
regalique situ pyramidum altiuS,
quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens
possit diruere aut innumerabilis

5 annorum series et fuga temporum.
Non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei
vitabit Libitinam; usque ego postera
crescam laude recens ; λ dum Capitolium

1 ff. exegi: emphasizing the
completion of the work. Horace
may have had in mind Pindar's
boast‚ P. 6, 7 ff. ἑτοῖμος ὕμνων
θησαυρὸς . . . τετείχισται . . . Ι τὸν
οὔτε ·χειμε’ριος ὄμβρος ἐπᾳκτός
ἐλθὼν ἐριβρόμου νεφέλας, 1 στρατὸς
ἀμείλιχος, οὔτ’ ἄνεμος ἐς μυχοὺς ἁλὸς
ἄξοισι παμφύρῳ χεράδειΙ τυπτόμε-
νον. ‘A ready treasury of song has
now been built. . . . neither winter
storm‚ coming fiercely from the
thunder cloud, a grim host, nor
wlnd-blast shall carry it to the
secret recesses of the sea, beaten
by the sweeping rubble.' Cf. also
Ovid's imitation of Horace in the
epilogue to the MetamorphoseS,
iamque opus megi quod nec lovis
ira nec τρεῖς Ι nec poterit ferrum
nec edax abolere vetustas, etc.

2ff. situ: pila—pyramidum:
the lofty pyramids have naturally
been a measure of man's supremest
accomplishrnent in both ancient
and more modern times—quod:
such that, etc. —edaxz frequently
applied to time, eg. Anth. Lat.
1167, 46 M. qnae non lempus edax,
non rapit ira lovis. Claud. Carm.

min. 34, 5 aetatis spatium non
tenuavit edax. - impotens : power-
less to lzarm, not ‘weak,' as in 1,
37, 10.—-fuga: cf. 2, J4‚1 fugaces
anni ; 3, 29, 48.

6 f. non omnis moriar, etc. ε cf.
Ovid's imitations Am. 1, 15, 42
parsque mei multa superstes erit ‚⁰
alet. 1 5, 87 5 f. parte tamen meliore
mei super alta perennis Ι astra
seran—Libitina: the goddess at
whose temple all the requirements
for funerals were rented out and
where the registry of deaths was
kept. Therefore by metonymy‚
‘the rites of death.'

7. usque: still, on and on.—
crescam: i.e. ‘my glory.'—re-
cens: ever new—dum Capito-
lium, etc.: in the last half of the
first century before our era the
vast extent of the Roman em-
pire and the fixity of Roman in-
stitutions made a strong appeal to
the imaginations of men; the per-
manence of Rome became the
measure of all permanence3 it is
at this time that we find the phrase
urbs aeterna first applied to the
city. Horace and others chose
