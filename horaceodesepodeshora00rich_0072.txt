‘The earth is freed from winter's thrall; Venus leads her bands,
the Nymphs and Graces dance3 Vulcan stirs his fires (1—8). Now
crown thy head with myrtle ancl with flowers‚ now sacrifice to Faunus.
Life is glad and lures one on to hope (9—12). But Death is near at
hand, my Sestius: to-morrow Pluto's dreary house will shut thee in,
no delight in wine or love is there (13-20).'

To L. Sestius Quirinus, probably a son of the Ρ. Sestius whom
Cicero defended. He was a partisan of Brutus, and very likely Hor-
ace's acquaintance with him began with the time of their service
together in Brutus' army. Later Sestius accepted the new order
of things without giving up his loyalty to Brutus' memory, and was
appointed consul suffectus (July-December, 23 B.C.) by Augustus.
Cf. Dio Cass. 53, 32.

Few of the odes are more skillfully planned. The underlying
thought is one expressed by Horace in many forms: ‘the world is
pleasant and offers many joys: take them while you may, for death
is near.' With this Book 4. Ode 7 should be compared. The verses
are apparently based on a Greek model, possibly the same as that
of Silentarius in the Antlz. Pal. 10, 153 or did Silentarius follow
Horace? ἤδη μὲν ζεφύροισι μεμυκότα κόλπον ἀνοίγει Ι εἴαρος εὐλείμων
θελξινόοιο χάρις· Ι ἄρτι δὲ δουρατέοισιν ἐπωπλίσθησε κυλίνδροις Ι ὁλκὰς
ἀπ’ ἠιόνων ἐς βυθὸν ἑλκομένη. ‘Now the grace of charming spring
which brings back fair meadows opens the bay that roars under Zephy-
rus' blasts. Only yesterday did the merchantman glide on the rollers,
drawn down from the land to the deep) The date of composition
is uncertain, but cf. v. 14 and n. which may fix the date at 23 ΒΕ.
The position here gives Sestius, who was consul in 23, the fourth
place in honor after Maecenas, Augustus, and Vergil. Metre, 81.
