3. 27, 117

HORATI

oscinem corvum prece suscitabo

solis ab ortu.

Sis licet felix, ubicumque maviS‚
et mernor nostri, Galatea, vivaS,
15 teque nec laevus vetet ire picus

nec vaga cornix.

Sed vides quanto trepidet tumultu

pronus Orion ?

Ego quid sit ater

Hadriae novi sinus et quid albus

20 peccet Iapyx,

plena pluviam vocat improba voce.
—oscinemz a technical term in au-
gury for birds that give omens by
their cries3 to this class belong
all the birds named in this ode
(cf. Festus quoted above); those
whose flight was significant, such
as the eagle and vulture, were
called alites.—solis ab ortu: a
favorable quarter.

, 13 f. sis: optative subjunctive.
—licett added paratactically in
the sense of per me licet. to show
that he will not hinder. Cf. Plaut.
Rud. 139 mea quidem hercle causa
salvos sis licet. -memor nostri:
cf. 3, 11, 51. The phrase is a
formula of farewell.

15 f. laevus : when observing
the omens the Roman auspex sat
facing the south so that the east
—the quarter in which good
omens appeared — was on his left,
therefore laevus and sinister in
the technical usage may mean fa-
vorable 3 the Augustan poets‚ how-

ever, influenced by the Greek
usage, employ both words in the
sense of ‘unlucky,' so that confu-
sion frequently follows. Here
laevus is unfavorable. -— vaga z
flitting.

17 ff. sed vides, etc.: suddenly
the poet remembers the dangers
to which Galatea will be exposed,
and exclaims thus in anxious warn-
ing. The abruptness of this
strophe after the smoothness ofthe
preceding corresponds to the
change in mma-trepidet: as
if the constellation were tremblmg
at the storrn it caused. —pronusz
as he sets-3 cf. 1, 28. 21 devexus
Orion. —aterz zie. with the storm,
but the word has also by associa-
tion the meaning ‘gloomy,' ‘fataL' ·
Cf. 1. 28, 133 37, 27: 214, 17.—
albus . . . Iapyx: cf. 1, 7, 15
albus Notus and n. — peccet:
how treacherous he is. — Iapyx:
the last two verses show that Hor-
ace has in mind a voyage to Greece.
