5f. The sight of the god has
filled the poet with mingled sear
and joy and raised him to ecstasy‚
in which he joins in the Bacchanal
cry euhoe, euhoe (εὐοῖ). Cf. 2, 11,
17. —trepidatt the sight ofa divin-
ity was always fearful to mortals.
Cf. ll. 20, 131 χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοῖ
φαίνεσθαι ἐναργεῖς.-ΡΙΘΠο . . . pec-
tore: the god possesses him fully.
Cf. 3, 25, 1 quo me, Bacche, rapis
tm' plenum? Iuv. 7, 62 satur est
cnm dicit Horatius euoe. —turbi-

q dum: accusative expressing the

manner of his joy3 cf. 2, 12, 14
lucidum fulgentis oculos.

· 7 f. parce.. .parce: in eager ap-
peals to the god to spare him the
maddening touch of the thyrsus.
——gravi metuende thyrso: cf. 1, 12,
23 metuende certa Phoebe sagitta.

9. fas. . .est‚ etc.: without sur-
ther warning the ecstatic poet be-
gins his song, for the vision has
given him certain inspiration.——
pervicacis: the never tirz'ng, persis-
tent. Cf. Epod. 17, 14 where the
adjective is applied to Achilles.—
Thyiadas: properly the women who

celebrated the ὄργια in honor of the
god3 from θύω, ‘to rush wildly.'
10 ff. Wine, milk, and honey are
the signs of Bacchus* fructifying
power. The verses were probably
suggested by Euripides' Bacchae
142 f. ῥεῖ δὲ ’γάλακτι πέδον, ῥεῖ δ’
οἴνῳ, ῥεῖ δὲ μελισσᾶν Ι νέκταρι, also
706ff. ἄλλη δὲ νάρθηκ’ ἐς πέδον
καθῆκε γῆς, Ι καὶ τῇδε κρήνην ἐξ·
ανῆκ’ οἴνου θεός · Ι ὅσαις δὲ λευκοῦ
πώματος πόθος παρῆν, Ι ἄκροισι
δακτύλοισι διαμῶσαι χθόνα Ι γάλ-
ακτος ἑσμοὺς εἶχον· ἐκ δὲ κισσίνων Ι
θύρσων γλυκεῖαι μέλιτος ἔσταζον
ῥοαί. ‘One in earth's bosom
planted her reed-wand. Ι And up
there-through the God a wine
fount sent : Ι And whoso fain would
drink white-foaming draughts, Ι
Scarred with their finger-tips the
breasts of earth, Ι And milk gushed
forth unstinted : dripped the while Ι
Sweet streams of honey from their
ivy—staves.' (XVay.) So the chil-
dren of Israel were promised Exod.
3, 8 ‘a good land and a large—a
land flowing with mill< and honey.'
—truncis . . . mella: cf. Horace's
