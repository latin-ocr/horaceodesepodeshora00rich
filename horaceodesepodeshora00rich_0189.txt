1 ff. For the careful arrangement
of words, see Intr. 28 c. — non
semper, etc. : cf. 2, 11, 9, and Her-
rick, ‘Clouds will not ever poure

cleere again. Ι First, peales of
thunder we must heare, Ι Then lutes
and harpes shall stroke the eare.’—

2. mare Caspium: the stormy
character of this sea is mentioned
by Mela 3, 5 mare Caspium omne
atrox, saevum, sine portubus, pro-
cellis undique expositum. It is
probable. however, that Horace's
choice of this concrete example and
of Armeniis in oris (cf. n. to 1, 1.
14) was determined by the coming
reference to Augustus' successful
diplomacy in the East (vv. 20—24).

3f. inaequales: gusty, squally.

-usquez temporal, as 1, 17, 4.- ·

bility of the glacier. — glacies iners:

7f. Gargani: with this Horace
returns to Italy for his example.
Garganus is a thickly wooded
mountain in Apulia, especially ex-
posed to storms. Cf. Epist. 2,
1, 202 Garganum mugire putes
nemus ant mare Tuscum. — quer-
ceta . . . laborant: cf. 1, 9, 3sz'lvae
laborantes.-viduantur: are wid-
owed of, the climax of his figures
of desolation. The tempora] idea.
varied by semper usque, mensis per
omnis, continues to the end of the
second strophe.

Nature. —urges : pnrszcest, dwell-
est 0n‚· used by Propertius (5, 11,
1) as if the mourning distressed
