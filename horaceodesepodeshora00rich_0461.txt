EPODON

Lmen [17, 14

Movit nepotem Telephus Nereium,
in quern superbus ordinarat agmina

ιο Mysorum et in quem tela acuta torserat.
Unxere matres Iliae addictum teris
alitibus atque canibus homicidam Hectorem,
postquam relictis moenibus rex procidit
heu pervicacis ad pedes Achillei.

’Doard which, when whirled at the
end of a string‚ made a whirring
noise, and was supposed to exer-
cise a charm over the intended
victim. To loose the spell it was
whirled in the opposite direction
(retro). It is still in use among
some uncivilized peoples. See
Andrew Lang‚ Custom and Mytlc,
p. 29 ff. Cf. Theoc. ld. 25 30 f.
χώς δινεῖθ’ ὅδε ῥόμβος ὃ χάλκεος,
ἐξ Ἀφροδίτας Ιῶς κεῖνος δινοῖτο
ποθ’ ἁμετέρῃσι θύρῃσι. <And as
whirls this brazen wheel, so rest-
less, under Aphrodite’s spell, may
he turn and turn' about my doors,
(Lang). Lucian, Dial. Afferetr.

· 4, 5 describes its use.

8—18. Three mythical examples
of the effectos supplication. Tele-
phus, King of the ⁷Mysians, was
wounded by Achilles when ,the
Greeks landed at Troy. His
wound would not heaL and he was
finally forced to come as a suppliant
to his enemy, in accordance with
an oracle which said he could be
cured only by the rust of the spear
that had struck him. Aged Pri-
am's prayers made Achilles relent
and give back Hector⁷s body. Circe

allowed Odysseus' companions to
regain their human form.—-ne-
potem . . . Nereium: Achilles*
mother Thetis was the daughter of
Nereus.

11. unxere: 228. prepared for
burial Hector's body. —addictum ι
tle. destined to be tlze foed of,
etc.‚ as a consolation to Patroclus'
shade. Cf. ll. 23, 179 ff. χαῖρέμοι,
ὦ Πάτροκλε, καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισι·
πάντα γὰρ ἤδη τοι τελέω, τὰ πάροι-
θεν ὖπζστην. Ι δώδεκα μὲν Τρώων
μεγαθύμων υἱέας ἐσθλοὺς Ι τοὺς
ἅμα σοὶ πάντας πῦρ ἐσθίει · ρΈκτορα
δ’ οὗ τι Ι δώσω Πριαμίδην πυρὶ
δαπτέμεν, ἀλλὰ κύνεσσιν.

12. homicidam : reproducing
the Homeric ‘'‘Emwp ἀνδροφόνος.

13 f. rex: Priam. For the Ro-
mans the pathos of the situation
lay not in Priam's loss of his son,
but in the fact that this mighty
king was forced to humiliate him-
self and weep for his son before
Achilles. Cf. ll. 24, 509 f. ὁ μὲν
’Έκτορος ἀνδροφόνοιο Ι κλαῖ’ cifimus
προπάροιθε ποδῶν Ἀχιλῆος ἐλικ
σθείς. Itis said this passage moved
B‘Iacaulay to tears. —- pervicacis:
abi-limate. but yielding in the end.
