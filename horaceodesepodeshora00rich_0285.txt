ordinarily worn. Augustus had
declined the triumph which the
senate proposed for his return, but
there was probably a supplicatio in
its stead.-virginum : the brides
of the iuvenum. For this meaning
of virge, cf. 2, 8, 2 3. — nuper sospi-
tum: just now returned in safezy.

10 ff. vos: the last of the three
classes here distinguished — the
matmns, the young soldiers with
their brides‚ and the unwedded
boys and girls.—n0n virum ex-
pertae: 2'.e. nondum nuptae. —
male ominatis z the hiatus is harsh‚
and can only be explained on the
supposition that the two words
were regarded as expressing a
single idea. But the text of this
entire line is very much in dispute.
—parcite verbis: cf. Epod. 17, 6.
The meaning is the same as 3, 1,
2 favete linguis.
