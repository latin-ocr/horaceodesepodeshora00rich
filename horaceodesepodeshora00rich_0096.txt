1, 12, 1] HORATI

This ode, like the second of this book, is in honor of Augustus, who
is celebrated as greatest of all the long line of Roman heroes, the vice-
> gerent of Jove. The mention of Marcellus (46) makes it probable
that the date of composition was either 25 Bc„ when Marcellus was
married to Augustus* daughter Julia and adopted as the Emperor‘s son.
or in any case between that date and Marcellus' death in 23 B.C. The
opening verses were suggested by Pindars ode in honor of Theron
(O. 2) which begIns ἀναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι, Ι τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα
δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν; Horace proceeds, however‚in·very different fashion
from Pindar, who answers his question at once: ‘Of the Gods, Zeus3
of demigods, Heracles3 of men, Theron the victor.' Metre, 69.

companied his recital with the

sang their songs in honor of their
ancestors (laudationes) to the
music of the tibia. -acriz λιγείῃ,

while Horace does not often dis-
tinguish the Muses. it is possible
that here Clio is invoked in her pe-
culiar character as Muse of History.

foot of Helicon was the village of
Ascra, in which there was a shrine
ofthe Muses (μουσεῖον) and a guild
of poets of which Hesiod (eighth
centuryss.C.) was the most famous.
The mountain was also farned for
the springs of Hippocrene and
Aganippe. Pindus was between
Thessaly and Epirus3 likewise a
haunt of the Muses. Haemus
was the seat of an early cult essf the
Muses and the traditional home
·of a Thracian school of poetry.
