HORATI

Tarquini fascis dubito, an Catonis

Regulum et Scauros animaeque magnae
prodigum Paullum superante Poeno

was not stained with any baseness.
Cic Phil. 3, 9. Tarquinius . . . uon
crudelis, non hupins, sed superbus
habitus est el chelas . . . nillil hulln'le
de Dzrquim‘o, m'ln'l sordidum ac-
cepimus.

35 f. Catonis nobile letum: Hor-
ace passes in his examples of Ro-
man virtus from the last of the
kings to the last great republican.
Cato's choice of suicide at Utica
(46 B.C.) rather than of submission
to the new order of things, is fre-
quently referred to by his con-
temporaries and by writers of the
following century in terms of the
highest praise. Cf. Cic. ad fam.
9, 18 Pompeius, Scipio, Afranius
in bello civile foede perierunt, ‘ al
Cato praeclare.' No question was
raised as to Cato's honesty of pur-
pose, and he became a kind of
canonized hero. Augustus' policy
of allowing praise of all that was
noble in the champions of the re-
public made it possible for Horace
to do honor to Cato even in an ode

glorifying the emperor. indeed

Augustus wisely forestalled his·

opponents by praising Cato him-
self.

37 ff. Horace here returns to the
heroes of an earlier time—Regu-
lum: Regulus was a traditional

instance of that ancient Roman
manhood (virtus) that preferred
his country's honor to his own life.
The fifth ode of the third book
holds up his sels-sacrifice as an
example for the youth of Horace’s
own time. — Scauros: referring
chiefly to M. Scaurus and his son.
The father was called by Valerius
Max. 5, 8, 4 lumen et de'clts palriae;
the son was involved in the defeat
on the Adige in 101 B.C. and shared
the panic-stricken ssight under Ca-
tulus. His father sent him a mes-
sage saying that he should rather
have found his dead body than see
him alive after sharing in such a dis-
grace, whereupon the young man
killed himself. Valer. Max. l.c.‚·
Aur. V ict. 3, 72 in conspectum suum
veluit accedere ‚· ille ob lzoc dedecus
mortem sibi conscivit. —- prodigum ε
cf. Ovid. Am. 3, 9, 64 sanguinis
atque animae predzge Galle tuae. —-
Paullum: L. Aemilius Paullus, who
chose to die at the battle of Can-v>
nae (216 Bc.) rather than escape,
as he might have done with honor,
according to Livy's account (22,
49)-

39. gratus: either of Horace's
own feeling of gratitude toward so
noble a character, or simply ‘'pleas-
ing,⁷ ·in verse pleasing my readers.‘'
