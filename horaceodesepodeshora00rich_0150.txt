HORATI

declinat Pholoen; sed prius Apulis
iungentur capreae lupis

quam turpi Pholoe peccet adultero.
10 Sic visum Veneri, cui placet imparis
formas atque animos sub iuga aenea
saevo mittere cum ioc0.

. Ipsum me melior cum peteret VenUS,
grata detinuit compede Myrtale
¹5 libertina, fretis acrior Hadriae
curvantis Calabros sinus,

Lyde3 thus through Echo, Pan, Ι
Lyde, and Satyr, Love his circle
ran' (Myers).

— tenui fronte ς a point osbeauty‚
as Lycus' black hair and eyes of the
preceding ode. Cf. Epist. 1, 7, 26
nigros angusta fronte capillos ,· Pe-
tron. 126 frons minima el quae
apices capillormn retro flexerat. —-
Lycorida: the name is apparently
taken from the elegies of Gallus,
as Pholoe from those of Tibullus
(ι, 8, 69)-

7. declinat: sc. a Lycoride.

9. turpi . . . adultero: low-born
lover. —peccetz cf. 1, 27, 17 ingenuo

13 ff. ipsum me: the usual per-

sonal experience. Intr. 3o.—me-

trast is furnished by libertina v. 15.

15 f. fretis acrior Hadriae: con-
cessive. The same figure is used
3, 9, 22 f. improbo Ι iracundior
Hadria. The Adriatic was pro-
verbially rough. Cf. Ι, 3. 15: 2,
14, 14.—curvantis: when it lzol-
lows out3 i.e. in time of storm.
Cf. Ovid Mel. 11, 229 est sinus

‘Careless of Heaven, devoted to a mad philosophy, I was forced by, ¹
a bolt in the clear sky to change my course and to remind myself that

God can put down the mighty and exalt the low)
The ode tells its own story and must not be taken too seriously‚ for

it may have been based on a Greek model. For Horace's religious views,

see Sellar, p. 159 ff. Mede, 68.
