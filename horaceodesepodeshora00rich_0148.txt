otism that made him take a vigor-
ous part in the politics of Mytilene,
especially against the tyrants Myr-
tilus and Pittacus. His sentiments
were expressed in political odes,

off. With these verses cf. 2,
13, 26 ff. et te sonantem plenius
aureo, Ι Α lcaee, plectro dura navis,
dura fugae mala, dura belli.—
ferox bello: against the tyrants
named in last note, and also
against the Athenians in the Troad.
The following tamen shows that
the phrase is concessive—inter
arma, sive, etc. : ‘in war or exile.'

7 f. religarat . . . litore: cf.
Verg. Α. 7, 106 relegarat ab aggere
classem. Intr. 95. — udo: sea-
beaten.

9 ff. ‘Wine and love were still
the subjects of Alcaeus' song, as
they must be of mine)

11 f. Lycum: a favorite of Al-

caeus. Cf. Frg. 58 written ap-
parently in anger, οὐκέτ’ ἐγὼ
Λύκον ἐν Μοΐσαις ἀλέγω. —nigris
oculis, etc.: points of beauty.
Note the shift of quantity nigris
. . . nigro. The description is
repeated Epist. 2, 3, 37 spectan-

οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐίσης Ι

nold's verses, quoted on 1, 10, 6.
15 f. cumque: temporal, modi-¹
fying vocanti and equivalent to
quandocumque te vocabo. No

parallel can be adduced to this use ·

of cumque as an independent
word, but we can safely accept
Porphyrio's explanation, who did
not find the phrase unintelligible.
— mihi salve : accept my greeting.
Cf. Verg. Α. 11, 97 f. salve aelec-
num milei, maxuma Palla, Ι aeter-
numque vale.
