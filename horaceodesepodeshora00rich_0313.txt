In dithyrambic strains Horace celebrates ‘the eternal glory of

Caesar.'

The poet imagines himself carried away by the power of

Bacchus to the wild haunts of the Naiads and Nymphs, where he will
sing his new and loftier theme. The ode has the form of an introduc—
tion to 3 larger work3 the mention of the Emperor is apparently
merely incidental‚ but forms the real subject of the verses. The occa·

sion is unknown. Metre, 71.
