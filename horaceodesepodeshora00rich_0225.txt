CARMINA

[2, 19, 32

Rhoetum retorsisti leonis
unguibus horribilique mala,

25 quamquam choreis aptior et iocis
ludoque dictus non sat idoneus
pugnae ferebaris; sed idem
pacis eras mediusque belli.

Te vidit insons Cerberus aureo

30 cornu decorum, leniter atterens
caudam, et recedentis trilingui

ore pedes tetigitque crura.

Hesiodic myth Bacchus, with Her-
cules, gave victory to the godsin
their battle against the giants in
the Phlegraean fields. The story
of this attempt by the giants to
storm heaven was confused with
the older one of the Titans, if in-
deed it did not owe its origin to
it.—retorsisti: alliterative with
Rhoetum, expressing the force with
which the giant was thrown back.
—leonisz the god took on the lion's
form, as when he was beset by
pirates, who tried to make him
captive. Hom. Hymn 7, 44.

25 ff. Bacchus' double nature
often appears—quamquam: cor-
rective, and yet, with ferebaris.—
choreis.. .dictus: sc. a diis, giving
the reason for the gods' disbelief in
his prowess.——sed idem: still thou
wast the samen—mediusque: for

the position of -que‚ see Intr. 31.
——belliz with medius, the earliest
example of this construction irni—
tated from the Greek. It was em-
ployed by later poets, eg. Ovid.
Met. 6, 409 qni locus est iuguli
medius summique lacerti.

29 ff. te vidit, etc.: when Bac-
chus descended to Hades tobring
back his mother Semele. —tez ct.
n. on tu v. 21.—- insons: predicate.
and did no lzarm to tllee. —aureo
cornu, etc.: the Greek χρυσόκερως,
κερασφόρος. Here the golde‘
drinking-horn is meant, rather than
the horn as an emblem of power.
— atterens : wagging. — recedentis :
as thou withdrewest‚· opposed to
the'god's entrance. implied in tc
vidit. —trilingui : cf. 2, 13, 34 where
Cerberus is centiceps. —tetigitque :
Intr. 31.
