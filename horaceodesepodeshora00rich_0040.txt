ἐξ 44-48] INTRODUCTION

sical time is ξ. While Horace adopted his measures from the
GreekS, he is more strict than his models in certain points. He
always uses an irrational spondee in place of a trochee before the
first cyclic dactyl (- >Ι -υ υ, and not — υ Ι ww) 3 and if an
apparent choriambus -ψ υ Ιι- 1 is followed by a second apparent
choriambus in the same verse, the caesura regularly separates the
two.

The following logaoedic verses are used by Horacez

45. The Adom'c .·

&uls-u

terruit Ι urbem t
(This may also be read Lu υ Ι ιζ Ι Ξ Λ)

46. The Art'stoplzanic:
Ᾰυυ Ι L υ Ι L >

Lydia Ι dic per Ι omnes t
(This may also be read -Ιυ ψ Ι Lu Ι [ΔΙ Ξ Λ)

47. The Pherecratic (read as a syncopated tetrapody catalectic) ε

L > ι -so o 1 Ι-ίι ΛΑ
grato Ι Pyrrha sub Ι αηΙίνο

48. The Glyconic .-

L>l -ίυ vl -s- ull-A
sic te Ι diva pollens Cylpri

i.e. that both equal J ἒς whereas the irrational spondee must be represented

in musical notation by 2⁰2·- Furthermore the musical equivalent of the

cyclic dactyl, as commonly expressed, -υ υ = ἓξ 2, is hardly correct3

it should rather be 202050. In the schemes as here given the form -υ υ
is used when the caesura does not fall within the foot or falls between the two
short syllables, -υ ΙΙ υ ; when the caesura occurs after the long syllable the
foot is written — ΙΙ υυ.

1 This combination was regarded by the later Roman writers as a choriam-
bus, — υ υ -, and many still give the name ‘ choriambie ’ to metres in which
this succession of syllables occurs·
