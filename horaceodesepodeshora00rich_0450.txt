HORATI ο

in verba iurabas mea,
5 artius atque hedera procera adstringitur ilex
lentis adhaerens bracchiis,
dum pecori lupus et nautis infestus Orion
turbaret hibernum mare
intonsosque agitaret Apollinis aura capiIIOS,
10 fore hunc amorem mutuum.
O dolitura mea multum virtute Neaera!
narn si quid in Flacco viri est,
non feret adsiduas potiori te dare noctiS‚
et quaeret iratus parem;

phrase in verba alicuius iurare
was originally a technical expres-
sion for taking the military oath of
fidelity to the general, then ex-
tended to include any oath of
allegiance. Cf. Epist. 1, 1, 14
iurare in verba magistri.

5. artius atque: cf. 12,14 miuus
ac. For the figure, cf. C. 1, 36, 20
lascivis hederis ambitiosior.

7. durn, etc.: giving the oath
in indirect form. In the form in
which the sentence was first con-
ceived v. 7 was a complete idea
dum pecori lupus et nautis infestus
Orion (esset). The following verse
contains an attribute of Orion
which would naturally be expressed
by qui turbaret, etc. This was,
however, made the predicate of
infestus Orion to parallel v. 9, so
that dum pecori lupus is left with-
out a verb. In translating supply
esset with lupus. For the com-
parison ofthe wolfand the lamb, cf.
4, 1 and n. On Orion as a storm-

bringing constellation, cf. 10, 10
tristis Orion, and C. 1, 28, 21 f. de-
vexi rapidus comes Orionis Ι Notus.

9 f. ⁶ So long as Apollo's youth
shall last,⁷ zze. ‘ forever.' Cf.
Tibul. Ι, 4, 57 solis aelerna est
Phoebo Bacchoque iuventas, Ι nam
decet intonsus crinis utrumque
deztm.—hunc: tlzis love (ff aurs.
—mutuum : reqm'ted. Catullus
says of Septumius and Acme 43,
20 mutuis animis amant amantur.

11 f. virtute: literally. ‘spirit
that becomes a man ’ς the idea is
repeated in sz' quid. . . viri est. —
Flacco: use of the proper name
instead of me gives the same
dignity to the expression that is
lent to Teucer's words C. 1, 7, 27
nil desperandum Teucro duce et
auspice Teucro.

13 f. potiori : more favored
rival, as C. 3, 9, 2 nec quisquam
potior. — parem: lle. one who
will return true love with like: 1n
sense equivalent to se dignam.
