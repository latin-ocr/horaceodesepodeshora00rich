In dithyrambic strains Horace hymns the power of Bacchus. He pre—
tends that he has unexpectedly discovered the god in a retired spot. and
then filled with a divine frenzy bursts into song, celebrating the deeds
and attributes of the divinity who has inspired him. Much of the ode
was probably suggested by Euripides' Bacchae. It may be compared
with the praise of Mercury Ι, ῐο; cf. also the beginning of 3, 25. The
date of composition is uncertain. Metre‚ 68.
