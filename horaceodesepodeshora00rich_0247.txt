seu voce nunc mavis acuta,

seu fidibus citharave Phoebi.

5 Auditis, an me ludit amabilis
insania? Audire et videor pios
errare per IUCOS, amoenae
quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.

but fanciful.— dic age: come play
upon tlzy dn'pe, etc. Cf. 1, 32,
33 2, 11, 22. -— regina: thus ad-
dressed‚ since she rules the poet's
song3 cf. 1, 6, 103 2, 12, 13f.
So Venus is called regina (3, 26,
1¹) ‘queen of love.'—Calliope:
with no reference to Calliope's
special province as the muse of
epic poetry. Cf. 1, Ι, 32 and n.
The invocation may have been
suggested by Alcm. Frg. 45 Μῶσ’
ἄγε, Καλλιόπα, θύγατερ Διός,
ἄρχ’ ε’ρατῶν ἐπέων, or by Stesich.
Frg. 45 δεῦρ’ ἄγε, Καλλιόπεια
λίγεια —seu voce, etc.: the ex-
pression is somewhat confused:
Horace prays the Muse to sing
either to the accompaniment of
the pipe (tibia), or of the lyre
<fidibus citharave) or with her
clear, treble (acuta, equivalent to
λίγεια above) voice alone—fidi-
bus citharave: the distinction be-
tween cithara and lyra was early
confused (cf. the Hom. Hymn. ad
Merc. 423 λύρῃ δ’ ἐρατὸν κιθαρί-
ζων), and Horace is obviously here
thinking of a single instrument.

5ff. auditis: in his imagina-
tion the poet hears already the

243

voice of the Muse. — insania: the
poetic ecstasy called by Plato
(Phaedr. 245 A.) ἀπὸ Μουσῶν
κατοκωχή (possession) τε καὶ
uada—videor: sc. mihi. Cf.
Verg. E. 10, 58 f. iam milti per
rupes videor lucosque sonantis Ι
ire. — pios lucos: the haunts of
the Muses, consecrated by their
presence.

8. quos . . . subeunt: beneatlz
which glz'de. subeunt is connected
by a slight zeugma with aurae.
Sappho, Frg. 4, describes in similar
fashion the garden of the nymphs
ἀμφὶ δ’ὗδωρ l <ἵψοθεν> ψῦχρον κελά-
δει δῖ ὕσδων Ι μαλίνων, αἶθυσσομέ-
νων δὲ φύλλων Ι κῶμα καταρρεῖ.
‘All around through branches of
apple-orchards 1 Cool streams call,
while down from the leaves a-trem-
ble Ι Slumber distilleth’(Symonds).

9ff. ‘I have been favored by the
Muses from my infant years'3 ex—
plaining why he may be able to
hear the Muses’ song while duller
ears cannot. Similar stories are
told of Pindar, Stesichorus, Aes-
chylus, and others. Cf. Tennysom
Eleanore 2, ⁴ Or the yellow-banded
bees„ l Thro‘ half open latticesl
