jectives belong to each noun. Cf.
4, 6, 31 f. —dis quibuS, etc.: the
guardian gods in general, not
limited to Apollo and Diana.—
placuere: lzave found favam· cf. 3,
49 24.

9 ff. Apollo as the sun god.
Cf. v. 16f. of the oracle καὶ Φοῖβος
Ἀπόλλων Ι ὅστε καὶ ἠέλιος κικλή-
meran—alme: cf. 4, 7, 7 almum
diem. — alius et idem: another
and yet the sama—possis: opta-
tive subj.—-nihil urbe, etc. z cf.
Verg. Α. 7, 602 f. maxima rerum
Roma, and Pausanias 8, 33, 3 with
reference to Babylon, Βαβυλῶνος
. . . ἥν τινα εἶδε πόλεων τῶν τότε
μεγίστην ἥλιος.

12 ff. The goddess of child-
birth, Ilithyia (tacitly identified
with Diana).—maturos: in due
season. — aperire ε with lenis,
which is a part of the prayer— be
thou gentle, etc. -— Ilithyia : among
the Greeks we find now one, now
many, goddesses so called. In

the inscription we read deis llz'tt'zyis
and in the oracle Εἰλειθυίας, but
the inscription gives the prayer
llz'llzyia, utitibei, etc. There can
be little question that the goddess
was identified with Diana, although
the adjective Lucina properly be-
longs to Jun03 Genitalis is appar-
ently Horace's invention, possibly
to represent the Greek Γενετυλλίς.

15 f. sive . . . seu: in early
Roman religion the divinities were
not clearly conceivedg hence arose
the habit of addressing them in
prayers by various appellations
that they might not be offended,
eg. sive deus sive dea ,· sive quo alio
nomine te appellari volueris3 etc.

17 ff. producas ε rear. — de-
creta: with reference to the lex
Iulia de maritandis ordinibus
passed the preceding year. This
was a law to discourage celibacy
and to encourage marriage and
raising of children (cf. 4, 5, 22 and
n.).—-super: in regara' t0,· cf.
