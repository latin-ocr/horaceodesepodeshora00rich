LIBER [2. 53

Sabina qualis aut perusta solibus
pernicis uxor Apuli,
sacrum vetustis exstruat lignis focum
lassi sub adventum viri,
45 claudensque textis cratibus laetum pecus
distenta siccet ubera,
et horna dulci vina promens dolio
dapes inemptas adparet;
non me Lucrina iuverint conchylia
50 magisve rhombus aut scari,
si quos Eois intonata fiuctibus
hiems ad hoc vertat mare;
non Afra avis descendat in ventrem meum,

folds. — laetum: sturdy, lusty.

47 f, horna . . . vina: the com-

chylia : the Lucrine lake near
Baiae produced the best oysters,
which are meant here—scari: so
highly esteemed that it was called

ἐγκέφαλος · τὸ κάλλιστον βρῶμα.

51 f. si quos: the scar was
