2, 7· 9]

ΗΟ RATI

Tecum Philippos et celerem fugam
ιο sensi, relicta non bene parmula,
cum fracta virtus et minaces
turpe solum tetigere mento,

Sed me per hostis Mercurius celer
denso paventem sustulit aere;
¹⁵ te rursus in bellum resorbens
unda fretis tulit aestuosis

‘tamalapattram‚' the leaf of the
‘tamela' tree, identified with the
fragrant laurel. Here of course
the oil prepared from the leaf.
The adjective Syrius was applied
in general to all oriental goods, for
which Antioch was the empo-
rium.

9 f. tecum: emphatic. Cf. me
13, te 15.—relicta . . . parmula:
no doubt Horace ran away with
the others at Philippi, but only
blind pedantry could take these
words literally. If Horace had
been very earnest he would not
have used the diminutive parmula 3
he was ‘ reconstructed ' and recon-
ciled so that he was ready to joke
at his own expense after the model
of Archilochus Frg. 6 ἀσπίδι μὲν
Σαΐων τις ἀγάλλεται, ἣν παρὰ
θάμνῳ Ι ἔντος ἀμώμητον κάλλιπον
οὐκ ἐθέλων Ι αὐτὸς δ’ ἐξέφυγον
θανάτου τελος · ἀσπὶς ἐκείνη Ι ἐρ-
ρέτω · ἐξαῦτις κτήσομαι οὐ κακίω.
‘Some Saian glories in my shield
which quite against my will Ileft
beside a bush — a good shield too
it was. Still 1 escaped death's end.

The shield may gog som-e other
day I'll get one just as good.'

11 f, minaces: for all tlzez'r
threals. — turpe ε the character of
their action — we might expect tur-
piter magere—is transferred to
the dust. Intr. 99.—solum teti-
gere mento: in mock heroic imi-
tation of the Homeric phrase, ll.
2, 418 πρήνεες ἐν κονίῃσιν ὀδὰξ
λαζοίατο γαῖαν.

13 f. Horace was saved too
like the Homeric heroes. Cf. ll. 3,
380 f. τὸν δ’ ἐξήρπαξ’ Ἀφροδίτη Ι
ῥεῖα μάλ’ ὥς τε θεός, ἐκάλυψε δ’
ἄρ’ ἠέρι πολλῇ. -— Mercurius: the
guardian of poets. Cf. 2, 17,29viri
Mercuriales and n. —paventemz
another hit at himself as imbellzlv.

15 f. te: emphatic contrast
with me v. 13. — rursus in bellum ε
connect with both resorbens and
tulit. The figure is that of the
retreating billow that sweeps its
victim out to sea. Horace says
of his own entrance into war,
Epist. 2, 2, 47 civilisque rudem
belli tulit aestus in arma. -
fretis: abl„ with its bm‘ling stood
