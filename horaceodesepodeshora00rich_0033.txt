themes and treated them with all the grace his taste and skill
could give. He shows little deep thought or intense feeling, his
verses are either exercises suggested by Greek lyrics, common-
places of philosophy, Stoic or Epicurean, pretty but passionless
treatment of themes of love, and society verse. Some tributes to
friends show greater feeling, as do certain odes dealing with inter-
ests of state3 yet in this latter class some seem like perfunctory
verses written to please. In his later odes, in which he celebrates
Augustus as the restorer of peace and prosperity‚ he exhibits a
warmth of sentiment that he does not show elsewhere in the poems
which concern the imperial house. Yet if his themes are com-
monplace, his treatment of them is so unapproachably felicitous
that his phrases have become part of the world's vocabulary.
Horace, therefore, deserves the high place he occupies in men’s
regard, not for his poetic inspiration, but because be has given
beautiful and permanent expression to ordinary truths, which are
of universal concern.

His vocabulary is not large, partly because the Latin language
in comparison with the Greek is poor in words, partly because he
chose to be restrained and moderate in statement; and the diffi-
culty of using the Alcaic and Sapphic measures in Latin doubtless
restricted the range of expression. He occasionally repeats a
happy phrase, either exactly or with slight variation. His admira-
tion for the Greeks never led him to violate the genius of his own
language 3 he did not attempt long compounds, avoided Greek
words for the most part, and seldom used a construction that was
foreign to the Latin idiom.

The study of Horace's style, therefore, is chiefly concerned
with the art with which he formed his phrases and fitted them to
his measures. The following paragraphs deal briefly with the
Order of Words, Prosoafif, Mares, and Si’nlax.

18. Order of Words.—-An inflected language admits greater
freedom in the arrangement of words than is possible in one which

is uninflected, so that an idea is often held in suspense until it has
