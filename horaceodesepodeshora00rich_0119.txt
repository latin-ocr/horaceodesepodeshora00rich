name of Bacchus formed from
the bacchanal cry εὐοῖ. Cf. 2, 19,
5. Notice that Horace employs
here indiscriminately Latin and
Greek names ofthe god —— Bacchus
6, Liber 7, Euhius 9, Bassareus 11
—his purpose being simply to
secure variety.

10. exiguo fine, etc.: willa ap-
pelite's marrow bound alam& lle.
when men in their greed (avidi)
make their passions the sole meas-
ure of right ancl wrong. In the
following verses Horace expresses
his thoughts, --1 will not abuse thy
gift, fair Bacchus,' in the language
of the Dionysiae mysteries.

11. non ego: the common per-
sonal note giving force and con-
creteness to the general statement.
For the order of words, see Intr.
21. 30.—candide: used of brilliant
youthful beauty‚ ‘fair and young'
(Wickham). Cf. Ovid Fast. 3,
771 ff. — Bassareu: an epithet
formed from the Greek βασσάρα,
a foxskin. This was worn by the
bacchanals‚ who are themselves
called in the Orphic hymn 44, 2 A.
βασσάραι.

12. quatiam: arouse, κινήσω,
properly applied to the thyrsus
and other symbols of the god,
as by Catull. 64, 256 lzarum pars

lecta quatiebant cuspide thyrsos.
—- variis obsita frondibus: the
sacred symbols (olgia) placed
in baskets (cistae) and covered
with ivy, grape, or fig leaves, etc.
Cf. Catull. 64, 254 ff. and Theoc.
26, 3 ff.

13. sub divum : into [lle lq'ght of
day: cf. Ι, Ι, 25 manet sub love
srzgz'do venator. -saeva tene,
ete: ‘And we pray thee, Bacchus,
do not excite our minds unduly
lest we fall into excess.'—saeva:
of the souncl, “the wild din of.'
Cf. Verg. A. 9, 651 saeva salw-
rz'blts arma, and Catull. 64, 261 ff.
plangebant aliae proceris lym-

cautla—Berecynthio cornu: cf. 3,
19, 18 f. car Berecyastln'ae cessant
flamina libiae. This is properly
the horn used in the orgiastic
cult of Cybele on Mt. Berecynthus
in Phrygia: by extension applied
to the horns employed in the wor-
ship of Bacchus.

14 f. quae subsequitur, etc. : lle.
in the train of mad ecstasy inspired
by the god follow all too readily
self-love (amor sui), boasting (glo-
ria) and faithlessness (arcani fides
