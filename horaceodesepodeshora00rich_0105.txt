CARMINA [·1, 14, 4

ἀσυνέτημι τῶν ἀνέμων στάσιν· Ι τὸ μὲν ’γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται μ

μωνι μοχθεῦντες μεγάλῳ μάλα · Ι περ μὲν γὰρ ἄντλος ἷστοπὲὃιιν ἔχει. !
λαῖφος δὲ πὰν ζάδηλον ἤδη Ι καὶ λάκιδες μεγάλαι κατ’ affro· Ι χόλαωι

now from this side, now from that, and we with our black ship are car-
ried in the midst, struggling hard with the mighty storm. For the
flood surrounds the mast step, the canvas is utterly destroyed, great
rents are in it; and the yard-ropes are loosened.' The most familiar
modern example of this allegory is Longfellow“s The Bm'ldz'ng af the
Sszzp. ‘Thou‚ too, sail on, O Ship of State 1⁷ etc.

Apart frorn other considerations the poem is interesting as a sign
that Horace's attitude toward the new government had changed from
that of his student days when he served in Brutus' army (cf. v. 17 f.).
The date of composition is most probably between the battle of
Actium, 31 BC , and the reorganization of the empire in 27 B.C.: in
any case it was written at a time when civil war was lately past, but
serious men still had reason to be anxious for the public peace: and
we must remember that however lightly Horace treated many subjects,
his attitude toward the state was that of earnestloyalty. See Sellar.
pp. 29, 151 ff. Here Horace expresses his feeling that the state can-
not endure another civil war, and that peace must be preserved. Cf.
with this ode Estod. 7 and 16. Metre, 73.
