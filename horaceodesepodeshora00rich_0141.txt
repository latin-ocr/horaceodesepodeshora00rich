See n. to 1, 3. 1.—fluctibus Hespe-
riis : apparently the Adriatic. Since
Italy was called Hesperia, any waves
that beat on its shore may be called
by this name—Venusinae: the
woods near Horace's birthplace‚
about forty miles inland on the
ridge of the Apennines, and so ex-
* posed to the winds.

the wind spend its fury on the
woods, and thou be safe ‘from
barm! The abl. abs„ te sos-
pite. is the important part of the
prayer. —- merces : reward. — unde :
referring to ab Iove. Cf. 1, 12,
17.

29 f. custode Tarenti: Taras‚the
mythical founder of Tarentum, was
said to be the son of Neptune and

a local nymph. Some Tarentine
coins bear the figure of the sea god
seated on a dolphin. Next to
Jove, Neptune is naturally the god
who could confer most benefits on
the milon—neglegis committere:
wilt llzon carelessly commit 2 The
question is asked as the sailor
starts to turn away.
