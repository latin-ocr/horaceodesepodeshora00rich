HORATI

porrectum ante foris obicere incolis
plorares Aquilonibus,

ς Audis quo strepitu ianua, quo nemus
inter pulchra saturn tecta remugiat
ventiS, et positas ut glaciet nivis

puro numine Iuppiter?

Ingratam Veneri pone superbiam,

ιο ne currente retro funis eat rota:
non te Penelopen difficilem procis
, Tyrrhenus genuit parens,

O quamvis neque te munera nec preces
nec tinctus viola pallor amantium

3f. porrectum: outslretclzed.—
obicere: object of plorares—in-
colis ε native to that region.

5ff. The lover continues his ap-
peal to Lyce's pity.—nemus inter
pulchra, etc.: the second court,
perz'sefylz'um, in the houses of the
rich was often large enough to con-
tain trees. Cf. Epist. 1. 10, 22
nempe inter varias nutritur silva
columnas.—ventis: abl. of cause.
—ut, etc.: the question belongs by
zeugma to audis, the exact force
of which has been lost by distance.
—puro numine: in cloudless maj-
esty (Smith). Cf. 1, 34, 7. —-
Iuppiter: as god of the sky. Cf.
n. to 1, Ι, 25.

11 ff. ne currente, etc.: lest the
rope slep from tlzee as tlte wlzeel
runs back‚· tle. thy present haughty
virtue is sure to break. The figure

is that of a wheel‚ possibly a wind·
lass, which suddenly flies back-
ward, carrying the rope with it. —
retro: with both currente and eat.
Intr. loo—non te, etc.: with the
order and expression, cf. Verg. A.
4, 227 f. non illum nobis genetrix
pulcherrima talem Ι promisit. —
difficilem: mzyieldz'7zg5 cf. 3, 7, 32.
—Tyrrhenusz far from being astern
Sarmatian. Lyce is of Etruscan
birth 3 and the effeminacy and vices
of the Etruscans were notorious.
13 ff. quamvis, etc. 2 the indic. is
not common until later. *tinctus
viola pallor 2 the lover's proper color
according to Ovid A. A. 1, 729
palleat omnis amans 3 hic est color
aptus amanti. The yellow, not
the purple, violet is meant.—
paelice: abl. of cause—saucius:
this bears the emphasis, ‘thy hus·
