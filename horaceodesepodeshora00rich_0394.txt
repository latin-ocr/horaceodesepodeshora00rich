HORATI

(C. S. 13 ff.) ; and on the third night a sow big with young was sacri-
ficed to Tellus (C. S. 29 ff.).1

After the sacrifice of the first night, scenic representations were
begun on a stage without seats for the audience, and continued uninter-
ruptedly throughout the festival; beginning with the first day, however,
they were given in a theater erected for the occasion (ludi Latini in
theatro lzgneo quod erat constitutum in campo secundum Tiberim).

On the first day Augustus and Agrippa each sacrificed a white bull
to Jupiter on the Capitol, and the following day each a white cow to
Juno in the same place3 on the third day, when the festival reached its
climax, Augustus and Agrippa offered consecrated cakes to Apollo and
Diana at the temple of Apollo on the Palatine (cf. introductory n. to 1,
31) 3 and then twenty-seven boys and 3 like number of girls, especially
chosen for this service, sang the hymn which Horace had written for the
occasion, and repeated it on the Capitol (sacrificioque perfecto pueri
XX V ll quibus denuntiatum et puellae totidem carmen cecinerunt ,· eodem-
que modo in Capitolio. Carmen composuit Q. Horatius Flaccus). In
addition to these ceremonies 110 matrons conducted selleslernz'a to
Juno and Diana on each day3 and ludi circenses and ludi honorarii
were continued seven days (June 4—11) after the close of the festivali-²

The ode itself lacks the grace and ease of most of Horace's lyric
verse3 its formal phrases when read seem stiff and rigid. Doubtless

1 The verses of the oracle ordering these ceremonies are as follows:—

μεμνῆσθαι, “Ρωμαῖε, . , .

ῥέζειν ἐν πεδίῳ παρὰ. θύβριδος ἄπλετον ὕδωρ,
ὅππῃ στεινότατον, νὺξ ἡνίκα γαῖαν ἐπέλθῃ,
ἠελίου κρύψαντος ἑὸν φάος· ἔνθα σὺ ῥέζειν
ἱερὰ παντογόνοις Μοίραις ἄρνας τε καὶ αἶγας
κυανέας, ἐπὶ ταῖς δ’ Εἰλειθυίας ἀρέσασθαι
παιδοτόκους θυέεσσιν, ὅπῃ θέμις· αὖθι δὲ Γαίῃ
πληθομένη χοίροις ὗς ἱρεύοιτο μέλαινα.

2 The oracle prescribes these rites also in detail : —

πάνλευκοι ταῦροι δὲ Διὸς παρὰ βωμὸν ἀγέσθων
ἤματι μηδ’ ἐπὶ νυκτί· . . .

. . . δαμάλης δὲ βοὸς δέμας ἀγλαὸν Ἠρης
δεξάσθω νηὸς παρὰ σεῦ. καὶ Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων,
ὅστε καὶ ἠέλιος κικλήσκεται, ἶσα δεδέχθω
θύματα Λητοίδης. καὶ ἀειδόμειόί τε Λατῖνοι
παιᾶνες κούροισι κόρῃσί τε νηὸν ἔχοιεν
ἀθανάτων. χωρὶς δὲ κόραι χορὸν αὐταὶ ἔχοιεν,
καὶ χωρὶς παίδων ἅρσην στάχυς, ἀλλὰ γονήων
πάντες ζωόντων, οἷς ἀμφιθαλὴς ἔτι φύτλη,

αὶ δὲ γάμου ζεύγλαισι δεδμημέναι ἧματι κείνῳ
’γνὺξ Ἠρης παρὰ βωμὸν ἀοίδιμον ἑδριόωσαι
δαίμονα λισσέσθωσαν.
