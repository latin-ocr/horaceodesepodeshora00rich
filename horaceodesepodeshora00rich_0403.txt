EPODON LIBER

Ibis Liburnis inter alta navium,
amice, propugnacula,
paratus omne Caesaris periculum
subire, Maecena5‚ tuo.
5 Quid nOS‚ quibus te vita si superstite
iucunda, si contra, gravis?

1. ibis: you are then really
going. Emphatic as fieremus v.
11. So Tibullus 1, 3, 1 says in his
address to Messala, who left him
behind in Corcyra when travel-
ing to the East in 30 Bc, ibitis
Aegaeas sine me, Alessala, per
undas. —Liburnis ε in contrast with
the alta navium propugnacula—
lofty battlemenled ships—of An-
tony and Cleopatra. These huge
galleons, some of which had as
many as nine banks of oars, proved
no match for the small swift two-
banked Liburnae of Octavian's
fleet3 the latter, modeled after the
vessels used by the Liburnian
pirates, in the imperial period
formed the chief part of the Roman
navy. Antony had felt his ships
invincible. According to Dio
Cassius 50, 18, he called to his
troops, ὁρᾶτε ’γάρ που καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ
τὸ μέγεθος καὶ τὸ πάχος τῶν ἡμετέ-
ρων σκαφῶν. Cf. also Vergil's
description of the battle, Α. 8,
691-693 pelago credas innare re-
volsas Ι Cycladas, aut montis con-
currere montibus altos: Ι tanta
mole viri turritis puppibus in-
stant.

4. tuo· sc. periculo.

5 f. nos: i.e. J and such as I.
The plural of modesty, which Hor-
ace uses in his lyrics only here and
C·1‚6‚5· 173 2‚17‚32; 3‚28‚9·
While we employ a verb in trans-
lating, it is improbable that the
Romans were conscious of any
ellipsis in such phrases as this. —
si superstite, etc.: the apparent
use of si with the abl. abs. is
anomalous. te superstite alone
would form a protasis to vita . . .
iucunda, and we should expect as
the alternative, te mortuo (vita)
gravis. To avoid the ominous te
mortuo, Horace euphemistically
says si contra, with which some
such verb as vivitur, or, as Por-
phyrio suggests, sit, is necessary;
this construction has its influence
on the preceding clause, so that
we must regard the entire relative
sentence as a condensed form for
quibus vita si te superstite (sit),
iucunda, si contra (sit), gravis.
The ellipsis is somewhat similar to
that in v. 8 below, ni tecum simul
(persequemur), etc. — superstite :
superstes here means ‘living on,'
elsewhere in the epodes and odes
‘out-living,' ‘surviving another's
death.'
