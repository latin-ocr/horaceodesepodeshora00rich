CARMINA s3, 5, 46

qui perfidis se credidit hostibuS,
et Marte Poenos proteret altero
35 qui lora restrictis lacertis
sensit iners timuitque mortem.

Hic, unde vitam sumeret insciuS,
pacem duello miscuit. O pudori
O magna CarthagO, probrosis
40 altior Italiae ruinis! ’

Fertur pudicae coniugis osculum

parvosque natos ut capitis minor
ab se removisse et virilem

torvus humi posuisse voltum,

45 donec labantis consilio patres
firmaret auctor numquam alias datO,

33 ff. perfidis: contrasted with
credidit, and emphasizing the cow-
ardice of the soldier who actually
trusted his life to an enemy whose
suithlessness was well known.
Punica fides was proverbial. Cf.
also 4, 4, 49 perfidus Hannibal
and n. — altero: a second. —
iners: predicate, tamely.

37 f. hic: vividly continuing
ille of v. 32. ——unde sumeret:
representing the anxious, unde
vitam sumam ‚9 of the coward
whose anxiety causes him to for-
get that he must fight‚ not bar-
gain, for his life. — duello: this
archaic form for bello is also found
3, 14, 183 4, ις, 8.—miscuit: lzas
failed ta dz'stz‘ngussh between.

40. ruinis: instrumental abl.
with altior— exalted over the, etc.

41 ffk fertur: and yet men say„
used to introduce a surprising
statement. Cf. 1, 16, 13. This
quiet account of Regulus' deter-
mination is in marked contrast
with the vehement pathos of the
preceding strophe. —ut capitis
minor: as one deprived of civil
rzghts, equivalent to the legal
(prose) formula capite deminutus.
The genitive is similar to the geni-
tive in integer vitae, milz'tz'ae nger.
Regulus felt that as a captive of
the Carthaginians he was no better
than a slave, who of course pos-
sessed no civil rights, and was
therefore unfit to enjoy the privi-
leges of a Roman paterfamilias.

44. torvus: grimly.

45 ff. donec . . . firmaret, etc..·
