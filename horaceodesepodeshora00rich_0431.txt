An appeal to the Romans not to renew civil war, written probably in
38 Β.(,. οη the eve of the outbreak of hostilities between the triumvirs
and Sextus Pompey. In August, 39 B.C., a treaty between the opposing
parties signed at Misenum had raised the hope that the exhausted
Roman world might have an opportunity to recover itself in peace3 but
within a year these hopes were disappointed. It was most natural then
that Horace should express himself in this gloomy way3 later he was
more hopeful of the state. Notice the dramatic form of which Horace
is fond. He makes a personal appeal to the opposing lines. Metre, 74.
