CARMINA

[3‚11,20

quae velut latis equa trima campis
ιο ludit exsultim metuitque tangi,
nuptiarum expers et adhuc protervo

cruda maritO.

Tu potes tigris comitesque silvas
ducere et rivos celeris¹ morari;
¹5 cessit immanis tibi blandienti

ianitor aulae

Cerberus, quamvis furiale centurn
muniant angues caput eius atque
spiritus taeter saniesque manet

9ff. For the comparison of a girl
to a colt or heifer‚ cf. 1, 23. 1 3 2,
5, 6. Also Anacr. Frg. 75 πῶλε
Θρῃκίη, τί δή με λοξὸν ὄμμασιν
βλέπουσα Ι νηλεῶς φεύγεις, δοκέεις
δέ μ’ οὐδὲν εἰδέναι σοφόν,· Ι . . . νῦν
δὲ ’λειμῶνάς τε βόσκεαι κοῦφά
τε σκιρτῶσα παίζεις, ‘Thracian
filly, why now dost thou look dis-
trustfully at me and fiee without
pity? Deemest thou rne a wit-
less fellow ? Now thou grazest on
the meadows and sportest‚ lightly
gamboling.'

——trimat as yet unbroken, for
colts were broken in their fourth
year. Verg. G. 3, 19o.—-tangi:
cf. 2, 2, 7 and n.—-cruda: not yet
matura,· cf. Stat. Th. 7, 298 f.
expertem thalami crudumque ma-
ritis Ι zgrnibus.

13 ff. The power of the lyre. Cf.
the similar passage 1, 12, 9ff. and n.

HOR. CAR. — 18

——comitesz in thy traz'n; predicate
with both tigris and silvas. For
the position of -que, see Intr. 31.—
cessit: gave way before thy charms
(blandienti). The reference is to
the visit of Orpheus to Hades to
bring back Eurydice. The story
is told Verg. G. 4, 457 ff.; Ovid
Met. 10, 8ff.— immanis z with aulae.
-blandientiz cf. 1, 12, 11 3 24, 13.

17 ff. furiale : fury-lzke.-eius:
some critics would reject this
strophe as prosaic‚ and especially
because eius here adds nothing to
the sense. These are insufficient
reasons for rejection, for Horace
did not always maintain the high-
est level in his verse—spiritus:
belonging by a zeugma to manet.
—manet : draps from. —ore trilin-
gui: Cerberus is three-headed in
2, 19, 3¹ also, but hundred-headed
