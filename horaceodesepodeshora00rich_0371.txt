CARMINA

[4‚ 9· 16

nee, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
ιο delevit aetas3 spirat adhuc amor
vivuntque commissi calores
Aeoliae fidibus puellae.

Non sola comptos arsit adulteri
crinis et aurum vestibus inlitum

et comites Helene Lacaena,

him thus: Stesichorus quam sit
ingenia validus materiae quaque
ostendunt, maxima bella el cla-
rissimos canentem duces el epici
carminis onera lyra sustinentem.
The last clause explains Horace's
adjective graves.

9. lusit: of light themes, in
contrast to the seriousness of Stesi-
chorus and the passion of Sappho.
With this use of the word, cf. 1, 32,
2. —Anacreonz a native of Teos,
who flourished in the second half
of the sixth century ss.C. He re-
sided at the court of Polycrates,
tyrant of Samos, and later at that
of Hipparchus in Athens. The
extant collection of poems called
Anacreontea are, however, of
· Alexandrian origin.

10 ff. spirat . . . vivunt: cf.
n. to 4, 8, 14.—commissi : with
amor and calores alike. The se-
crets of her love she intrusted to
her lyre. Cf. S. 2, 1, 30 ille (Lu-
cilius) velut fidis arcana sodali·
bus olim Λ credebat libris. — Aeoliae ε
cf. 2, 13, 24 and n.

13 ff. Horace now takes up the

more general aspect of his theme.
All his illustrations are from
Homer. Notice the variety of ex-
pression and the cadence of the
rhythm. —comptos . . . crines:
smoath lack53 the common object
of arsit, blazed witlz love'sfire, and
mirata, looked cm with wonderzug
admiration. The latter continues

¹with the three following accusa-

tives, while arsit is forgotten.
With this description of Paris, cf.
1, 15, 13 ff. and n.—inlitum:
‘smeared on,' the word is chosen
to emphasize the barbaric magnifi-
cence of Paris and his train.——
cultus: dress; cf. 1, 8, 16.—La-
caena: the epithet is added in the
epic fashion. Horace found models
in'the Greek writers for this ac-
count of the effect produced on
Helen's mind by the appearance
of Paris. Cf. eg. Eurip. Troad.
991 f. ὃν εἰσιδοῦσα βαρβάροις
ἐσθήμασι Ι χρυσῷ τε λαμπρῷν ἐξε-
μαργώθης φρένας. ‘At sig'rht of
whom, brilliant in his barbarian
dress and gold, thou lost thy
sensesst
