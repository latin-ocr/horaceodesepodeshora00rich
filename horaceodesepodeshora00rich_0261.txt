CARMINA

6

In the last ode of the series Horace considers the reasons for the
degeneracy of the times. These he finds to be the neglect of religion
and the growth of immorality that is destroying the family and making
each succeeding generation worse than the one which preceded it.

⁴ The sins of thy fathers shall be visited on thee, Roman, until thou
repairest the ruined temples of the gods and restorest the forgotten
saith of an earlier time. Thy power depends on thy humility toward
Heaven; it was in punishment for thy indifference that the Parthian,
the allied Dacian and Ethiopian almost destroyed our city (1- 16).
But more dangerous than foreign foes is the flood of immorality that
has swept over our state: all modesty and respect for marriage ties are
gone3 adultery is unabashed (17—32). lt was not the offspring of such
stock as this that saved the state from foreign foes in earlier days.
There. is no hope: we are worse than our forbears and our children
will be more degenerate than we (33—4'8).'

By its reference to the loss of military prowess this ode is naturally
connected with the preceding. In that, devotion to duty is the idea13
here, purity and simplicity of life, as exhibited by the Sabine stock.
The pessimistic close is surprising and shows that the six odes were
hardly composed originally to form a series. This ode was probably
written soon after 28 B.C., the year in which Octavian, by virtue of his
censorial power, tried to enforce ordinances intended to check the evil
tendencies of the times. See also n. to v. 2 below. Metre, 68.
