SYNTAX [§§ 94-99

‘the servants freed from toil.' 3, 27, 69 abstineto irarum, ‘give

up thy wrath.’
THE ABLATIVE

The simple ablative‚ without a preposition, is used somewhat
more freely than in prose.

95. The simple ablative is used to express the place where an
action occurs: 1, 2, 9 summa haesit ulmo, ‘clung in the top of
theeelm! 1, 9, 10 f. ventos aequore fervida depraelianlis, ‘ winds
struggling over the yeasty deep.’ 1, 32, 8 relegarat litere navim,
‘anchored his ships off the shore‚’ also belongs here.

296· Once in the Odes the ablative of agent is used without a
preposition: 1, 6, 1 f. scriberis Varia . . . flsaeom'i carminis alite,
‘thou shalt be sung by Varius, that bird of Maeonian song.'
With this we may compare Epist. 1, 19, 2 carmina, qaae scribun-
tur aquae potoribm, ‘verses written by teetotalers,’ although most
editors and grammarians regard potoribus as dative of agent.
While the phrase Vario . . . alife approaches the ablative abso-
lute, the difference between it and such cases as S. 2, 1, 84 iudice
laudatas Caesare must not be overlooked.

97. The instrumental ablative is found once with a verbal noun :
3, 4, 55 truncis iaculator, ‘ he who threw trunks of trees.’

98. With muto and a direct object the ablative is used to denote
both that which is given and that which is received in exchange 3
the context alone shows the relation: 1, 17, 1⁵„ f. Lucretilem mula!
Lycaeo, ‘exchanges Lycaeus for Lucretilis.’ The opposite 1, 16,
25 f. ego mitibus mutare quaero tristia, ‘ I seek to substitute kind
feelings for bitterneSS.'

‘ TRANSFERRED ' ADJECTIVES

99. An adjective which naturally expresses some quality of a
person or thing is sometimes transferred to an object or action
whichis associated with that person or thing: 1, 3, 38 ff. neque Ι
per nostrum patimur scelus Ι iracunda lovem ponere fulmina,
1, 15f1-33f1 iracunda . . . classis Achillei.
