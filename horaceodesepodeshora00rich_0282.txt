To the spring Bandusia. These exquisite verses may have been
occasioned by the festival of springs, the feminalia, which fell on
October 133 but the situation of the spring thus immortalized-—if
indeed it ever existed outside Horace·s fancy — is wholly unknown. A
document of 1103 A.D. mentions a fons Bandusinus near Venusia, but
it is very probable that this is an identification of the Middle Ages
rather than an ancient name. Bandusia seems to be a corruption of
Πανδοσία, and may have been given by Horace to the large spring on
his Sabine farm, fons etiam rivo dare nomen idoneus, Epist. Ι, 16, 12.
We need be little concerned, however, with the situation, for the verses
are sufficient in themselves. M etre. 73.

O fons Bandusiae, splendidior vitrO,
dulci digne mero non sine fioribUS,
cras donaberis haedo,
cui frons turgida cornibus

5 primis et venerem et proelia destinat3
frustra: narn gelidos inficiet tibi

1 f. vitro: crystal. Cf. Apul. 6. 22 (Fontanalz‘bus) et in fontes
Met. 1, 19 fluvius ibat argento vel coronas iaciunt et puteos coro-
vitro aemulus in colorem—dulci nant.
digne, etc.: note the effective al- 6 ff. frustra: the knell, all m
literation and assonance here and vain. Cf. 3, 7, 21. —- gelidos :
elsewhere in the poem. The wine cool (and clear), contrasted with
was poured and garlands thrown rubro, red (and warm). -inficiet
into the spring3 cf. Varro L. L. stain. —lascivi: sportz've.
