IO

The following four odes treat of love and good cheer in contrast to
the serious tone of most of the other odes of the book.

These eight verses addressed to a beautiful boy, Ligurinus (4, Ι, 33),
warn him that beauty fades and soon he will repent his present haughti-
ness. The subject may‘ have been suggested to Horace by certain
Greek epigrams. Cf. Anth. Pal. 12, 35. 186. Metre, 54.
