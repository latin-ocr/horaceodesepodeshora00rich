CARMINA

[2, 16, 10

July of that year M. Licinius Crassus enjoyed a triumph over the Thra·

cians and Getae.

In any case the verses came from the time when

Horace felt his happiness secured and his position as lyric poet sure, so
that he could scorn those who grudged him his position. Metre, 69.

Otium divos rogat in patenti
prensus Aegae0‚ simul atra nubes
condidit lunam neque certa fulgent

sidera nautis ;

5 otium bello furiosa Thrace,
otium Medi pharetra decori,
Grosphe, non gemmis neque purpura ve-

nale neque auro.

Non enim gazae neque consularis
10 submovet lictor miseros tumultus

meaning—-escape from the dan-
gers of the storm, relief from war,
and freedom from the anxiety that
ambition brings. —patentiz the
opem—prensus: caught, for the
more common deprensus. —simulz
cf. n. to 1, 4, 17.

31. certa: predicate, wilh sure

tions by which the ancient sailor
directed his vessel are meant by
the general term, sidera.
