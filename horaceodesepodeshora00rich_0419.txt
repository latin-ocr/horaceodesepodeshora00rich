The Romans were extremely superstitious, and during the last cen-
tury of the Republic especially, there was a rapid increase in the num-
ber of people among them who professed to practice the magic arts.
The efficacy of witchcraft and love potions was not doubted by the mass
of the people. In this epode Horace pictures four hags, of whom Cani-
dia is the chief, in the act of preparing one of their most potent charnis
by which Canidia hopes to win back the affections of her aged lover.
The quartette have captured a boy whom they propose to bury to the
chin in the atrium of Canidia's house, that he may starve. His death is
to be made the more painful by the sight of food frequently renewed.
that his longing for it may sink into his liver and very marrow. which
then shall be used for the* irresistible philter. It is not impossible that
children were occasionally murdered for such purposes3 at any rate
there was a current belief that such atrocities were practiced, as the
Chinese are said to believe to—day that the missionaries kill young thil-
dren to obtain the ingredients for certain charms. Cicero charges
Vatinius, z'n Vatin. 14 cum inaudita ac nefaria sacra susceperis, cnm
inferorum animas elicere, cum puerorum erlis deos manes waslare
soleas, etc. The following inscription, found in a columbarium on the
Esquiline, is also important testimony. CIL. 6, 19, 747 lltczcndus Liviae
Drusi Caesaris s(ilz'us) Gryphi et Vitalis. ln quartum surgens com-
prensus deprimor annum, Ι cum possem matri dulcis et esse patri. l
eripuit me saga manus crudelis ubique, l cum manet in terris et nocz't

pectore fixsus eat.

Commentators have been much puzzled as to the identity of this
Canidia, whom Horace mentions in two other epodes (323th ἡ717) and
m S. ¹2 8. Porphyrio says that she was a certain Gratidia from Naples‚
