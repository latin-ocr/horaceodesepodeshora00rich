HORATI

‘Leuconoe‚ give up trying to learn the secrets of the future. Be

wise, do thy daily task, and live to-day; time is swiftly fiying.'

This is

simply a variation of the theme (1, 9, 12 ff), qm'ct sit futurum eras,
fuge quaerere, et Ι quem fors dierum cumque dabit, lucro Ι appone.
Probably a study from the Greek, possibly of AlcaeuS, as are Ι, 18,

and 4, 10, the two other odes in the same measure.

Metre, 54.

Tu ne quaesieriS, scire nefas, quem mihi, quem tibi
finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios

temptaris numeros.

Vt melius quicquid erit pati,

seu pluris hiemes seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam

1. tu: emphasizing the requests
to his imaginary Leuconoe, whose
name is chosen for its pleasing
sound. By the collocation, quem
mihi, quem tibi, Horace represents
her as dear to him.—ne quaesi-
eris: archaic and colloquial for
the ordinary noli with the infini-
five—scire nefas: parenthetical.
Cf. Epod. 16, 14 nefas videre: and
for the thought as well, Stat.
T lzeb. 3, 562 quid crastina volveret
aetas scire nefas homini.

2 f. nec: with temptaris, con-
tinuing the prohibition, for the
more common neve. — Babylonios

. numeros: tlte calculations of
tlte, etc., employed in casting
horoscopes. After the conquests
of Alexander, astrologers made
their way to Greece from the
east in large numbers and had
established themselves in Rome
as early as the second century
B.C., where they did a thriving
business among the superstitious.

quae nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare

They had become a nuisance as
early as 139 Bc. when the prae-
tor peregrinus, Cornelius Scipio,
banished them ς but they still con-
tinued to practice their art through-
out the republic and especially
under the empire, in spite of many
attempts to rid Italy of them. Cf.
Tac. Hz'st. 1, 22 genus hominum
potentibus infidum sperantibus
fallax, qnod in civitate nostra et
vetabitur semper et retinebitur.

—ut: cf. Epod. 2, 10 ut gaudet
decerpens pira. -— hiemes: of years,
equivalent to a7znos; cf. 1, 15, 35
post certas hiemes.

5 f. oppositis debilitat pumici-
bus mare Tyrrhenum: pumices is
used of any rocks eaten by the
waves, cf. Lucret. 1, 326 vesco
sale saxa pereva. Sidon. Apoll.
10, 27 preminet alte Ι asper ab
assiduo lympharum verbere pu-
mex. The description given, how-
ever, is hardly appropriate to
the Tuscan Sea, in the region
