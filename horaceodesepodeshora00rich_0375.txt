An invitation to Phyllis to join in celebrating the birthday of Mae·
cenas.

ί(βοτηε, Phyllis, here is plenty, and my house is all abustle with our
preparations (1-12). We must keep the birthday of Maecenas, dearer
to me almost than my own (13—20). Telephus is not for thee, but for
a maid of richer station. Remember it was ambition that brought low
Phaethon and Bellerophon. Come then, last of my flames, and learn a
song to lessen thy love cares (21—36).⁷

In theme and treatment this ode is not unlike 3, 28. It is interest-
ing to note that it contains the only reference to Maecenas in this book,
which is so largely devoted to the praise of Augustus and his stepsons3
but the warmth of vv. 17—20 shows that no shadow had fallen on the
friendship between Horace and his patron. The year of composition is
unknown. Metre, 69.
