HORATI

17
A mock palinode addressed to Canidia3 in pretended terror at the
sorceress' power Horace pleads for mercy. Yet in his very prayer (1—
52), as also in Canidia·s reply (53—81)‚ he makes his sharpest attack by
rehearsing again all the charges he has ever made against her. Cf.

Epod. 5 and S. 1, 8. With the palinodic form, cf. C. 1, 16. The date
of composition naturally falls after these other 'two poems; it cannot be

more accurately fixed. Metre, 58.

citumque retro solve, solve turbinem.

1. iam iam: cf. 2, 68, where the

vocare: cf. v. 78 and n. to 5, 45.
—refixaz proleptic — unfix and,
as if the stars were fasteneci' to the
