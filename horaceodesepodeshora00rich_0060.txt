ι, 2] HORATI

2

⁴ We have been terrified enough with snow and hail, with lightning
and with fiood, portents that show Heaven’s wrath and threaten ruin
to our impious state. What god will come and save us? Apollo?
Venus? Mars? or Mercury? Aye, thou art already here. Remain
long among us, enjoy triumphs, the name of father and of chief, check
and punish the Medes, divine leader Caesar.'

While the first ode of the collection dedicates the poems to Maece-
nas, the second is a declaration of loyalty and devotion to the emperor.

The first six strophes review the portents that followed on the murder ·

of Julius Caesar. Cf. Porphyrio's comment on the opening words,—
post occisum C. Caesarem, quem Cassius et Brutus aliique coniurati
interfecerunt, multa portenta sunt visa. Haec autem omnia vult videri
in ultionem occisi principis facta et poenam eorum, qui bella civilia
agere nnn desinebant. With v. 25 Horace turns from the sins of the
Romans to the means of help. The following three strophes call on
Apollo, Venus, and Mars in turn to save their people. Finally, v. 41 ff..
Horace appeals to Mercury, who has taken on an earthly form, that of
the emperor. The ode culminates with v. 49 ff., the direct appeal to
Octavian, but the identification of Octavian with Mercury is not fully
announced until the last word of the ode.

The choice of the gods invoked was undoubtedly determined by the
subject of the ode. Apollo was the patron divinity of the Julian gens;
his first and only temple at Rome to the time of the one built by Augus-
tus was dedicated in 431 B.C., by Cn. Julius (Livy 4, 29) 3 the members ot
the gens sacrificed to him at Bovillae, according to an ancient rite, lege
Albana (CIL. 1, 807), and Octavian believed that the god had espe-
cially favored him at the battle of Actium. Cf. Prop. 5, 6, 27 ff., cum
Phoebus linquens stantem se vindice Delon Ι . . . adstitit Augusti pup-
pim super et nova flamma Ι luxit in obliquam ter sinuato facem. Verg.
Α . 8, 704, Actius haec cernens arcum intendebat Α pollo. Venus, mater
Aeneadum, as genetrix was the especial protectress of Julius Caesar.
Augustus is himself called (C. S. 50), clarus Anchisae Venerisque
sanguis. Mars is naturally appealed to as the father of Romulus* people.
The final identification of 'the emperor is especially interesting, for it
bears on the social and econoniic relations of the times. Under Octavian,
with the restoration of peace, trade improved and prosperity returned,
so that nothing could be more natural than to regard the man who
was bringing this about as the incarnation of the god of trade.
