15 Baccharumque valentium
proceras manibus vertere fraxinOS,

tante beatus Ι audiit Eurotas. —
et consilio Iovis: the deification
ofAugustus was early accomplished
by the poets of his court. Cf.
Verg. G. 1, 2·4 f. tuque aa'eo, quem
mox quae sunt habitura deorum Ι
concilia, incertum est. Also intro-
ductory n. to Ι, 2, p. 56 f.

7. insigne: cf. 1, 12, 39 and
n. The context makes it unneces-
sary to supply the obvious carmen.
Cf. n. to 1, 6, 5.

8 f. non secuS‚ etc. : the poet is
possessed by the divine influence
as fully as ever Maenad, who in
her ecstasy has wandered una-
wares far from her home to some
height where, suddenly coming to
herself, she sees before her the
valley of the Hebrus and Rhodope
beyond. ——exsomnis: the revels of
the bacchantes were carried on by
night. Sleeplessness is a character-
istic of the orgiastic state. — stupet:
zs amazed5 cf. Ovid, Trz'st. 4, 1,
42 (Bacche) dum stupet Idaeis
exululata z'ugsz.

10 ff. nive candidam: a tradi=
tional epithet of Thrace. Cf. ll.
14, 227 Θρῃκῶν ὄρεα νιφόεντα.-
pede barbaro lustratam: traced by
strangerfeet; z'.e. she has passed
out of her own country. —utz with
non secus in place of the more
common ac to avoid collision with
ac in the preceding verse.

13. ripas: used absolutely as
3, 1, 23.—vacuum: the sacred
grove (cf. 1, 1, 30) is untenanted
by mortals, so that the poet may
wander there at will (devio).

14 ff. Naiadum potens: cf. 1,
3, 1 and n. Also 2, 19, 33 and
Orph. Hymn 53, 6 Ναΐσι καὶ Βάκ-
χαις ἡγούμενε.-νε11611ῒίιιη1, etc.:
the bacchantes were supposed to
possess superhuman strength.
The special allusion is to the mur-
der of Pentheus at the hands of
the Maenads, who pulled up by
the roots the tree from which he
had overlooked their orgies, and
then in their frenzy tore him limb
from limb—vertere: equivalent
