‘ Like a young eagle swooping on his prey or a lion just weaned tear·
ing its first victim, so the Vindelici saw the young Drusus fight under
the shadow of the Raetian Alps. Now through defeat they have come
to feel what the noble young Neros, piously reared beneath Augustus'
roof, can do (1-28). Brave and noble are those who spring from noble
sires. Training is powerless when character fails (29—36). Thy debt‚
O Rome, to Nero’s line is witnessed by the Metaurus, the defeat of
Hasdrubal, and that glorious day when the fearful leader was forced by
the renewed strength of Rome to say ⁶⁴ We are but deer. This people,
tossed to this land from Troy destroyed by fire, gains strength through
loss, grows Hydra-like more strong. No more proud messages shall
I send to Carthage. All hope was lost when Hasdrubal was killed
(37—72).'' Such noble deeds have the Claudii done3 no bound is there
to what they yet shall do, with the aid of Jove's favor and man's wise
counsel (73—76).'

This and the fourteenth ode celebrate the victories in 15 ΒΕ. of
the young Neros, Drusus and Tiberius, stepsons ot Augustus. In the
spring of that year Drusus, then but twenty-three years old, led his
troops up the river Atagis (Adige) and defeated the Vindelician forces
not far from Tridentum (Trent). He then pushed northward across
the Brenner pass and defeated the Breuni and Genauni in the valley of
the river Inn. Tiberius approached from the west by the upper
Rhine and Lake Constance. and the armies under the two brothers
scoured the valleys in which the Rhine and Inn have their sources so
successfully that in a single campaign the district of the Grisons and
Tirol was completely subjugated and made into the province Raetia.

The occasion of this and the fourteenth ode, as Suetonius tells us
(vita Han), was the ‘command’ of Augustus—scripta quidem eius
usque adeo probavit mansuraque perpensa opinatus est, ut non modo
seculare carmen componendum inflaverit sed et Vindelz‘cam victoriam
