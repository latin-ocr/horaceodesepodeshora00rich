3, 3, 67] HORATI

excisus ArgiviS, ter uxor
capta virum puerosque ploret.’

Non hoc iocosae conveniet lyrae:
70 quo, musa, tendis? Desine pervicax
referre sermones deorum et
magna modis tenuare parvis,

69 ff. non hoc, etc.: Horace that all has not yet been said.—

suddenly checks his muse with the pervicax : persistent. — tenuare:
warning that his lyre is iocosa and tc] lessen, dwarf. Cf. 1, 6, 12 de-
not suited to such serious themes. terere,· Ι, 6, 9 nec . . . conamur,

The strophe is a mere device to tenues grandia. Also Prop. 4, 1,
close the ode. Cf. 2, 1, 37 ff. 5d2'cz'te, quo pariter carmen tenu-
—conveniet : the tense implies aslis in antro?

Horace begins this ode with a second invocation to the Muses and a
renewed pledge of his loyalty and devotion to them. It was they who
gave him safe escape at Philippi, protected him from the falling tree,
and rescued him from drowning. Under their guardianship he may
wander all unharmed among savage tribes on the very outskirts of tlfe
world (1-36). It is also they who protect mighty Caesar and aid him
with gentle counsel (37—42). At this point in the ode Horace turns
with apparent abruptness to the story of the giants' defeat in their
battle with the gods, and closes with a warning against dependence on
brute force and violence (42-80). No Roman!⁸ however, would fail to
see that Horace wished to present Augustus here as the vice-regent of
jove, and that the powers of violence are those of rebellion against the
emperor's moderate and beneficent rule. In the next ode the compari-
son is more outspoken.

The date of composition is approximately 26 B.C.; cf. n. to v. 33.

Descende caelo et dic age tibia
regina longum Calliope meIOS‚

1 ff. descende caelo: for the however, understood it to mean:
Muses dwell on Olympus, ll. 2, ‘Come back to earth from the
484 Μοῦσαι Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχου· council of the gods (in the pre-
σαι. The ancient commentators‚ ceding ode).' This is possible,
